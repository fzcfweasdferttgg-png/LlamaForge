"""Hardware-aware knob recommendations for LlamaForge (pure stdlib).

Turns detected hardware + a GGUF's header facts into a small set of
llama-server knobs, shaped by the user's intent. Memory sizing is llama.cpp's
own --fit; this only sets what fit doesn't decide. `recommend` is a pure function
(no I/O) so it is trivially testable; `refine` (Task 4) optionally benchmarks.
Only the ~8 knobs that materially affect fit/throughput are set; everything
else keeps llama.cpp's own defaults.
