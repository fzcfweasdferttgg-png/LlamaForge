"""Multi-model slots: where a model goes, and whether it fits at all.

With more than one model loaded, the router's own answer to "full" is to evict
the least recently used model, and llama.cpp's --fit (when it is not disabled
by a pinned n-gpu-layers) quietly shrinks the newcomer's context. Neither is
acceptable when the newcomer is a background job and the evictee is the model
the user is chatting with. So every multi-mode load asks plan() first.

plan() is pure: it sees one nvidia-smi snapshot (whose `used` already counts
the desktop, other apps and every loaded slot), the slots that are up, and the
candidate's memory need, and returns a verdict. A footprint measured on a
previous load of the same configuration beats the prediction; the prediction
only covers configurations never loaded before.

Measured on this project's dev box (2026-10-04): a process pinned to GPU1 still
opens a CUDA context on GPU0 (~231 MiB); one on GPU0 costs nothing on GPU1. A
vision projector lands on CUDA0 too, whatever the model's `device` says.

Pure stdlib, no I/O.
