"""Turn a raw router (llama.cpp) log tail into a one-line error + a suggested
fix for the model editor. Pure string heuristics, no I/O, so it's unit-testable
and the UI never has to make the user scroll the log panel to learn why a load
failed.

Two rules keep it honest (review 03 H6):
- Only the model's LAST load attempt is read. The router logs "spawning
  server instance with name=<id> on port <P>"; the child's own output comes
  back prefixed "[<P>]", and the router logs "instance name=<id> exited with
  status N". Anything else in the tail - earlier loads, other models - is not
  this failure.
- Patterns are llama.cpp's actual error strings. Broad words like
  "ggml_cuda" or "n_ctx" appear in every healthy CUDA load.
