"""Inference engines behind one interface.

llama.cpp and vLLM grew as parallel universes: separate registries (models.ini
vs vllm_models.json), separate schema builders, separate hub clients, separate
process control, and a duplicated route for every verb (/api/load and
/api/vllm/load, /api/save and /api/vllm/save, ...). They met in exactly one
place - merge_vllm_models - and only on the read side. Every caller that wanted
to act on "a model" had to know which engine it belonged to first.

That does not survive a third engine. ik-llama is next on the roadmap and needs
the same process-managed treatment vLLM has, which would mean a third column in
every one of those pairs and a three-way branch at each call site.

So: a Backend is the set of verbs the dashboard needs from an engine, and the
engines are implementations of it. `for_model(id)` answers "who owns this?", so
routes can dispatch on the model rather than on the URL. The per-engine modules
keep doing the real work - this is the seam that lets callers stop caring which
one is on the other side.

A Backend implements:

    name            str, matches the "backend" field in a model row
    available()     is this engine usable on this machine at all
    list_models()   [model row]  - the shape /api/state already returns
    schema()        knob schema for the editor
    load(id)        -> (ok, error)
    unload(id)      -> (ok, error)
    save(id, knobs) -> {"restarted": bool} - persist, apply to a live model
    delete(id)      -> (ok, error); raises Unsupported when it can't

Pure stdlib.
