"""The panel's ember scheduler: one background thread that runs due jobs.

Every TICK seconds it lists the embers, works out which jobs are due
(sched.due_jobs) and asks sched.decide what to do about the router. It runs
at most one job per tick, under the ember's cross-process lock, so the CLI
and the panel never run one ember at once.

Sharing the GPU: the router is only contacted when something is due. A job
waits while the router is busy or down; a job pinned to another model may
swap it in after SWAP_IDLE seconds of observed idleness and puts the previous
model back afterwards, unless the user loaded something else meanwhile.
Idleness is only ever observed, never assumed: the idle clock runs between
two looks at the same loaded model that show no work in between (the
router's decode counter did not move; without the counter, two idle looks at
most 2*TICK apart). Time nobody watched counts as activity, so the first look
after start or after a quiet spell never swaps. report() and n_ctx() are only
ever asked about the loaded model (asking about another one makes the router
load it), and never about a sleeping one (/metrics wakes it).

Pre-emption: before every model request (ask_json's retry too) the job checks
that our model is still the loaded one (sleeping counts), and requests go out
with autoload=false, so even a switch between the check and the request
never loads ours back over theirs. If the user loaded another model, or
unloaded ours, the call raises RouterUnavailable, so the job stops cleanly
(its raws stay pending). The GPU is then theirs: no restore. The end of any job, like a
swap, counts as router activity, so the next swap needs fresh idle minutes.

Everything that can go wrong is caught: tick() never raises, a broken ember
never stops the others, and the last problem is kept in status().

On a multi-model pool (pool injected and active): every model that is up
can run a job, and one that is idle itself runs even while another works.
A job pinned to a model that isn't up loads it as a worker beside the
others, through the planner, when nothing is generating and the planner
says it fits - no idle minutes needed, since nothing is evicted - and
unloads it afterwards unless the user made it the main or is using it. A
pool never swaps: the planner never evicts anything for a background job,
and the router's own load would bypass the device pins it writes.
Pre-emption there is our model leaving the pool.

Known limits: each ember has one wait clock at a time, so its later due jobs
start waiting (and count towards WAIT_MAX) only once the earlier job ran or
was skipped; behind a router that stays busy, an ember with ingest and brief
due can wait about two WAIT_MAX periods before both are skipped. And
`embers_cli tick` builds a fresh Scheduler, which has observed no idle time,
so it never swaps models; it has no pool either (the slot manager lives in
the panel's process), so on a pool it only sees the first model that is up
and never loads one.
