"""Which llama.cpp family can load a GGUF, read from its tensor type ids.

Mainline llama.cpp and ik_llama.cpp share ggml's type enum up to BF16 (30) and
MXFP4 (39), then diverge: each has quants the other lacks, and the loader
refuses a type it doesn't know with "invalid ggml type N" before it reads a
byte of weights. The tensor infos in the GGUF header say which types a file
uses, so this is known before anything loads.

It's advice, never a refusal: a third fork can reuse an id (PrismML's
llama.cpp fork also calls 142 PQ2_0), and LlamaForge can't tell which fork a
binary is. The enums below are from each project's ggml/include/ggml.h,
checked 2026-10-05; an id this table doesn't know reads as "unknown".

Ids also move with time: ik retired 142 (IQ2_TN) and later reused it for
PQ2_0, and an ik built in between crashes on a PQ2_0 file instead of refusing
it. So build_types() reads the enum of the ik checkout that's installed here.

Pure stdlib; for_model() reads only the GGUF header, via gguf.layout().
