# Voice

The **Voice** tab turns text into speech on your own GPU, optionally in a voice you recorded. LlamaForge does not do the speaking: llama.cpp ships a text-to-speech tool, `llama-tts`, and LlamaForge runs it with one of the models it supports, then gives you a UI and an OpenAI-style endpoint for it.

## Models

| Model | Size | Languages | Licence | Good for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Qwen3-TTS 1.7B](https://huggingface.co/ggml-org/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base-GGUF) | 2.1 GiB (Q8_0) | 10 | Apache-2.0 | Quality, any language, voice cloning. Best on a GPU. |
| [Pocket TTS](https://huggingface.co/EryriLabs/pocket-tts-GGUF) (English) | 209 MiB | English | CC-BY-4.0 | Speed: faster than real time even on a CPU. Always needs a voice clip. |

Install either or both from the tab. Getting Pocket TTS also saves a starter voice, a clip from Kyutai's [donated voices](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/tts-voices) (CC0), so it can speak right away.

> [!NOTE]
> Most TTS GGUFs on Hugging Face are made for other runtimes and do not load in `llama-tts`: for example the Qwen3-TTS and Pocket TTS repos packaged for qwentts.cpp, pockettts.cpp or CrispASR, and models such as Kokoro, Chatterbox, Dia, Orpheus or F5-TTS. `llama-tts` needs a backbone plus an `mmproj` audio projector of the `qwen3tts` or `pockettts` architecture.

## Set up

Two things are needed, and the tab tells you which one is missing:

1. **`llama-tts`**, next to your `llama-server`. Official llama.cpp builds include it. A source build from **Build / Update** builds it as well; an older source build may only have the server, so rebuild once.
2. **A model.** Each **Get** button downloads a backbone and its audio projector into `<root>/tts/models/` (or `tts_dir` in [config.json](config.md)); extra models go in a subfolder each. Speech models are kept apart from your chat models and never appear in the Models list. To add a compatible model by hand, put the `.gguf` and its `mmproj-*.gguf` in a new subfolder; the tab reads the architecture from the file.

## Speak

Type up to 2000 characters, pick a model (when you have more than one), a voice and, for Qwen3-TTS, a language (en, zh, de, it, pt, es, ja, ko, fr, ru), and press **Speak**. You get a waveform, a player and a WAV download.

Each request starts `llama-tts`, loads the model, speaks and exits, so no VRAM is held between requests. One request runs at a time. On an RTX 5080, a sentence takes about 3 to 4 seconds with Qwen3-TTS including the model load, a little faster than the audio plays back. Pocket TTS takes about a second for the same sentence, and about 1.5 seconds on the CPU alone.

## Voices

A voice is a short reference clip of someone speaking. The model speaks in the voice of the clip. **Record a clip** uses your microphone (up to 30 seconds), **Upload a clip** takes any audio file your browser can play. Either way, the browser converts it to 24 kHz mono WAV, trims the silence at both ends and asks for a name. Clips are stored as `<root>/tts/voices/<name>.wav`; 5 to 20 seconds of clear speech in a quiet room works best.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only clone voices you have permission to use: your own, or someone who agreed to it.

Without a voice, Qwen3-TTS picks its own; Pocket TTS uses your first saved voice, and refuses to speak if you have none. Set `tts_default_voice` in [config.json](config.md) to use one of your voices whenever a request doesn't name one.

## Use it from code

The panel serves `POST /v1/audio/speech`, shaped like OpenAI's speech API:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8090/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"tts-1","input":"Hello from my own GPU.","voice":"alloy"}' \
  -o speech.wav
```

- `input` (required): the text, up to 2000 characters.
- `voice`: the name of one of your voices. Names you haven't saved, like OpenAI's `alloy`, fall back to the default voice, so OpenAI clients work unchanged.
- `model`: which speech model to use, by the name the tab shows (the file name without `.gguf`, for example `pocket-tts-en`). Anything else, like OpenAI's `tts-1`, uses the first model.
- `language`: one of the codes above, default `en`. Ignored by single-language models.
- `response_format`: `pcm` returns raw 16-bit 24 kHz mono samples; anything else returns WAV. LlamaForge's backend has no audio codecs, so `mp3` or `opus` requests get WAV.
- `speed` is accepted and ignored.

Errors use the OpenAI shape (`{"error": {"message", "type"}}`): 400 for a bad request, 503 when speech isn't set up, 500 with the tail of the `llama-tts` log when it fails. When the router is reachable from your network (`router_host` is not `127.0.0.1`), the endpoint asks for the router's API key, as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or `x-api-key`, like the other endpoints on the panel.
