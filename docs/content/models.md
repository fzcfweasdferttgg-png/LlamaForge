# Models & Tuning

Tune every `llama-server` flag on a per-model basis, save named presets, and compare settings across models — all from the Models tab, without hand-editing `models.ini`.

## What it does

Each row in the Models list is a section of `models.ini` (or an auto-discovered model not yet added to it). Expanding a row opens a live knob editor built from the running `llama-server` binary's own `--help` output, so the available flags always match the binary you actually built — not a hardcoded list that can drift out of date across llama.cpp versions.

`backend/argspec.py` (`build_schema()`) runs `<server_bin> --help`, parses the column-aligned help text into typed, grouped knobs (bool, int, float, enum, path, string), and caches the result per `(server_bin path, binary mtime)` — the cache self-invalidates automatically if you repoint `server_bin` at a different binary or rebuild it (`backend/routes.py` `schema()`). A handful of flags the router itself owns (`host`, `port`, `model`, `hf-repo`, and similar) are filtered out of the editor as `RESERVED` — they aren't safe to set per model.

The editor has two density levels, controlled by `ui_mode` in `config.json`:

- **Lite** shows a curated set of common knobs (`n-gpu-layers`, `ctx-size`, `cache-type-k`/`cache-type-v`, `flash-attn`, `batch-size`, `ubatch-size`, `threads`, `tensor-split`, `temp`, `top-p`).
- **Advanced** exposes every flag the binary reports via `--help`, grouped under the section headers from the help text itself.

Because the flag count is entirely a function of your `llama-server` build, LlamaForge does not hardcode a number for it — it is whatever `--help` reports at the time the schema is built.

## How to use it

1. Open the **Models** tab and click a model's row to expand its editor.
2. Set the knobs you want to override. Unset fields inherit from the `[*]` global-defaults section of `models.ini`.
3. Click **Save + Reload**. This writes the changed keys into the model's `models.ini` section (`config.set_keys()`), and if the model is currently loaded, unloads it first, then tells the router to reload (`router("/models?reload=1")`) so the next load picks up the new settings — no dashboard or router restart required.
4. To reuse a set of knobs on other models, click **Save current +** in the preset bar to name the model's current settings as a preset. Click a saved preset chip on any other model's row to apply it (same save + reload path). Delete a preset with the `×` on its chip.
   - To make a preset a model's **default**, click the ◉/○ dot on its chip to *bind* it (`POST /api/presets/bind`). Binding writes the preset's knobs into that model's section now, and — the point of it — editing the preset later re-syncs every model bound to it. The bound chip is highlighted; clicking the dot again unbinds and leaves the knobs in place. Knobs you set by hand afterward still win, since they're written last.
   - To save a one-click **launch profile**, click **Save as profile** in a model's editor. A profile is the model plus an optional preset plus an optional **pinned engine build** (one of the official builds installed from Build / Update; leave it on "whichever build is active" to follow updates). Profiles appear as ▶ chips above the model list: one click switches to the pinned build if it isn't active (waiting for the router to come back), applies the preset, and loads the model. Builds a profile pins are never pruned by later updates; if a pinned build or preset has been removed, the launch stops with an explanation and changes nothing.
   - To **share** a profile, click ↗ on its chip and copy the **recipe**: readable JSON with the GGUF file name, the Hugging Face repo it came from (when it was downloaded through LlamaForge or sits in the Hugging Face cache), its knobs, and the llama.cpp build it was made on. Anyone can paste it into **+ import recipe** to get the same preset and profile; if the model isn't on their machine, **Download from <repo> & import** fetches the same file (all shards) and finishes the import. Recipes are untrusted input, so treat one from a stranger like code: every knob is shown before you apply it, and only tuning knobs are imported. Anything that touches paths or files (including any knob your engine types as a path), other hosts (`rpc`), keys, logging, CORS, server-side tools/MCP, the chat template, or model auto-downloads (`*-default` presets) is dropped and listed, as are knobs your engine doesn't know. GPU topology and CPU pinning (`main-gpu`, `tensor-split`, `split-mode`, `device`, `threads`, `cpu-*`) are never shared either: they only make sense on the machine that made the recipe. A value containing a newline rejects the whole recipe.
   - **browse recipes** opens the community gallery: tested setups from the repo's `recipes/` folder, each with the hardware it ran on, notes on its knobs, and an **on this machine** badge when the model file is already registered. **Import** prefills the import box with that recipe and runs it. The list is fetched live from GitHub (cached for 6 hours, **refresh** forces a fetch) and falls back to the copy bundled with your release when offline or rate-limited. Gallery files go through the same filter as a pasted recipe. To add one, export it with ↗, add an `about` block, and open a PR (`recipes/README.md`); CI rejects a gallery recipe that carries any knob the filter would drop.
5. To compare settings across models, click **Compare** above the model list, tick the checkbox on two or three rows (three is the most), then open the comparison. The table lists every knob key any selected model has explicitly set and highlights cells that differ between models; a blank cell marked "inherit" means that model falls back to the `[*]` default.
6. To auto-tune a model's knobs based on your hardware, use the **Refine** bar beside Presets: pick an intent (balanced / speed / context / coding), click **Run**, and it runs one short real completion (~200 tokens) per candidate and applies the fastest config. It is a quick check, not llama-bench. A results table shows tok/s per candidate and which was chosen.
7. To remove a stale or unwanted llama.cpp entry, click **Unregister**. This unloads it if necessary and removes only its `models.ini` section and preset binding; the GGUF file remains on disk. vLLM's separate **Delete** action still removes its managed WSL files.

8. To run several llama.cpp models at once, turn on **Multi-model (llama.cpp)** in [Setup](setup.md). **Load** then loads a model as the **main** model, on the fastest GPU that fits, and **Load as worker** (offered only beside a model that is already up) loads it beside the main one on the GPUs the main model doesn't use, and never unloads anything. An open row's editor says whether the model is the main model or a worker, and for an unloaded one whether it **Fits** (with the footprint, marked measured, predicted or a rough estimate) or **Won't fit**, with an **Unload ... and load** button when evicting workers would make room. **Make main** promotes a worker without moving or reloading anything. On the Stowage skin the same plan is drawn in the [bay plan](theming.md), where a model that isn't loaded shows as a dashed **booked** box. If the router running now was started single, the Models tab offers **Restart router**, which unloads whatever is loaded.
9. To run one model on a different llama.cpp build than the router's, use the **Build** selector in its editor (shown once there is more than one build to choose). **follow the router** is the default; picking an installed build pins the model to it (`model_builds` in `config.json`). A build other than the router's runs the model in its own `llama-server` process on its own port, so clients reach it at its own endpoint and [Embers](embers.md) can't use it. Changing the build unloads the model, and if a pinned build is later uninstalled the editor says **Build gone** and the model won't load until you pick another.

## Reference

| Concept | Source | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Live flag schema | `backend/argspec.py` `build_schema()` | Parses `<server_bin> --help`; cached by `(server_bin, mtime)`; refreshes automatically after a rebuild or binary change. |
| Reserved flags | `backend/argspec.py` `RESERVED` | Router-owned flags (`host`, `port`, `model`, `hf-repo`, etc.) are excluded from the per-model editor. |
| Hot reload | `POST /api/save` (`backend/routes.py`) | Writes knobs via `config.set_keys()`, unloads the model if running, then calls the router's `/models?reload=1` so `models.ini` is re-read live. |
| Presets | `POST /api/presets/save` / `/apply` / `/delete` / `/bind` | Named knob sets stored in `config.json`'s `presets` key; applying one follows the same save + reload path as a manual edit. **Bind** records the pairing in `preset_bindings` and materializes the preset into the model; re-saving a bound preset re-syncs every model using it. |
| Launch profiles | `POST /api/profiles/save` / `/delete` / `/launch` (`backend/profiles.py` `plan()`) | Stored in `config.json`'s `profiles` key as `{model, backend, preset, engine}`. Launch runs engine switch → wait for router → preset knobs → load, and reports which step failed. vLLM profiles can't pin a llama.cpp build or use a preset. |
| Recipes | `POST /api/profiles/export` / `/import` (`backend/recipes.py`) | `{llamaforge_recipe: 1, name, model: {id, file, hf_repo}, settings, engine: {tag, variant}}`. Import matches the model by file name (then id), creates a preset and profile with unique names, pins the build only if the same tag and variant are installed, and with `download: true` fetches a missing model from `hf_repo`. |
| Compare | Models tab, Compare toggle (`web/js/models.js` `openCompare()`) | Client-side diff of `settings` across two or more selected models; no separate endpoint. |
| Refine | Models tab, Refine bar (`POST /api/autotune/refine`) | Auto-generates knob recommendations for the selected intent, runs one short real completion (~200 tokens) per candidate, applies the fastest. A quick check, not llama-bench. Results table shows tok/s per candidate. |
| UI density | `ui_mode` in `config.json` (`"lite"` / `"advanced"`) | Lite = curated knob subset; advanced = the full parsed schema. |
| Multi-model | `POST /api/load` (`role`, `evict`), `/api/slots*` | With `multi_model` on, a load goes through the placement planner; see [HTTP API](api.md). |
| Per-model build | `POST /api/model/build` | Stores `{model: build}` in `model_builds`; blank follows the router. |
| Unregister | `POST /api/models/unregister` | Removes a llama-family `models.ini` section after unloading it; never deletes its GGUF file. |

## Troubleshooting

If the editor shows "Could not read knobs from `llama-server --help`", `server_bin` in `config.json` is missing, wrong, or the binary failed to run (missing DLLs is common on Windows). Fix the path from the Setup tab or `config.json` directly — the schema is retried automatically on the next open, no restart needed. If `--help` runs but returns no arguments, the help text format wasn't recognized; check the binary is actually `llama-server` and not a different tool.

See also [models.ini Format](models-ini.md) for the on-disk file this editor writes to, and [config.json Reference](config.md) for `server_bin` and `ui_mode`.
