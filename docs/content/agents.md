# Connect an Agent

Point a coding agent — Claude Code, Codex, or pi.dev — at your locally loaded models with one click, using either the Anthropic-compatible shim or the OpenAI-compatible router directly.

## What it does

LlamaForge exposes two HTTP surfaces a coding agent can talk to:

- The **router** (`router_port`, default 8080) speaks the OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` shape natively — this is what llama.cpp's router already serves.
- The **Anthropic shim** (`backend/anthropic_shim.py`, served from the panel on `panel_port`, default 8090) translates Anthropic's `/v1/messages` Messages API into the router's OpenAI request shape and back, including streaming SSE and tool use, so an Anthropic-API client like Claude Code can drive a local model without knowing it isn't talking to Anthropic. `to_openai_request()` maps system/messages/tools/tool_choice/stop_sequences into the OpenAI body; `to_anthropic_response()` and `stream_anthropic_events()` map the router's response (or SSE chunk stream) back into Anthropic message/content-block events. `/v1/messages/count_tokens` is served too, but only as an estimate (`count_tokens_estimate()`: ~4 characters per token over the translated prompt text, not a real tokenizer count).

Shim auth (`backend/routes.py` `_shim_auth_ok()`, called from `server.py`) accepts either header an Anthropic client might send: `x-api-key: <key>` or `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. It is skipped while `router_host` is `127.0.0.1` or no `router_api_key` is set. The panel itself remains loopback-only. Network Access requires a usable router key for every newly configured LAN router; the shim forwards the configured credential to the router where needed.

**Agent setup** (`backend/agentsetup.py`) generates the config each agent needs to point at LlamaForge, and can optionally write it in place:

| Agent | Config file | Format | Endpoint it's given |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude-code` | `~/.claude/settings.json` | JSON (`env` block) | The loopback Anthropic endpoint, `http://127.0.0.1:<panel_port>` — always local, never the LAN. |
| `codex` | `~/.codex/config.toml` | TOML (appended provider block) | Direct mode uses the router's OpenAI-compatible endpoint, `http://<host>:<router_port>/v1`; injected mode uses the loopback panel endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:<panel_port>/v1`. |
| `pi` | `~/.pi/agent/models.json` | JSON (`providers` block) | The same direct-router or injected-loopback choice as Codex. |

Claude Code's generated `settings.json` sets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to the shim endpoint, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` to the router key (your `router_api_key`, else the key LlamaForge generated for its own local router, else the literal string `llamaforge` — the shim needs a non-empty token even when auth is effectively open), `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, and `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL`. Codex's TOML block declares a `[model_providers.llamaforge]` section with `wire_api = "chat"` and, if a router key exists (yours or the generated local one), an `env_key` pointing at a `LLAMAFORGE_API_KEY` environment variable the user must set — the key itself is never written to the TOML file. pi's `models.json` sets `api: "openai-completions"` with the key embedded directly in the config.

Codex and pi can optionally be routed through the loopback panel proxy with
`inject=true` — this is how those two agents pick up wiki context injection (see
[Context Wiki](context-wiki.md)). An injected endpoint is local-machine-only;
direct Codex/pi configuration uses the router endpoint instead.

Preview generation returns config content and a human-readable target path/instructions without touching disk (used for "copy this into your config" display). Apply writes it — JSON targets are deep-merged into any existing file (`_deep_merge()`, so unrelated existing keys survive), and the Codex TOML target is appended only if the `[model_providers.llamaforge]` block isn't already present, commenting out any conflicting top-level `model`/`model_provider` line rather than deleting it. Apply backs up the target once, to `<path>.llamaforge.bak`, before its first write.

The preview may deliberately contain the Claude Code or pi credential needed for
that agent's native file. Treat it like Client Config: it is shown only after the
explicit POST request. Apply may use the stored key to write a file, but its
response never returns the key.

## How to use it

1. Open the **Setup** tab, find the **Connect an agent** card, and pick Claude Code, Codex, or pi.dev under **Agent**.
2. Choose a **Model** from the active llama-family engine (and, for Claude Code, a **Small model**). vLLM agent setup is deferred.
3. Press **Show configuration**. This is the only preview action: it is an explicit POST and is not fetched on render or selection change. For Codex or pi.dev, tick **Inject local context through the panel (this machine only)** only when the agent runs on this same machine.
4. Review or copy the preview, then click **Apply** only to write the config into the agent's real local config file.
5. Launch the agent. Claude Code must run on the same machine as LlamaForge — its endpoint is always `127.0.0.1`.

The same card carries a **pi coding agent** section and an **MCP server** section. **Install pi** fetches pi's published npm package into LlamaForge's own `agents/pi` folder with your Node.js (22.19 or newer; **Install Node.js** is offered when it is missing), **Update** reinstalls it and **Remove** deletes only that copy; LlamaForge uses `pi_bin` from `config.json` first, then its own copy, then `pi` on `PATH`. The MCP section gives copy-paste snippets that let Claude Code, Codex or any MCP client drive LlamaForge itself; see [MCP Server](mcp.md).

## Reference

| Concept | Source | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic request translation | `backend/anthropic_shim.py` `to_openai_request()` | Anthropic Messages body -> OpenAI chat body (system, messages incl. tool_use/tool_result, tools, tool_choice, stop_sequences). |
| Anthropic response translation | `backend/anthropic_shim.py` `to_anthropic_response()` / `stream_anthropic_events()` | OpenAI response/SSE -> Anthropic message / streaming content-block events. |
| Token estimate | `backend/anthropic_shim.py` `count_tokens_estimate()` | Advisory only: `len(text) // 4` over the translated prompt. |
| Shim auth | `backend/routes.py` `_shim_auth_ok()` | Accepts `x-api-key` or `Authorization: Bearer <key>`; skipped when `router_host` is `127.0.0.1` or no `router_api_key` is set. |
| Endpoint per agent | `backend/routes.py` `_agent_endpoint_for()` | Claude Code -> loopback Anthropic endpoint; direct Codex/pi -> router at `<host>:router_port/v1`; injected Codex/pi -> loopback panel at `127.0.0.1:panel_port/v1`. |
| Config preview | `POST /api/agent/config` | Explicit POST with `{agent, model, backend, small, inject}`; may deliberately contain Claude/pi credentials and does not write files. |
| Config apply | `POST /api/agent/apply` | Same targeting fields; writes to the real target path, JSON is deep-merged and Codex TOML appended if absent, original is backed up once. Apply never returns a key. |

## Troubleshooting

If Claude Code can't reach LlamaForge, confirm it's running on the same machine — the shim endpoint is hardcoded to `127.0.0.1` and never the LAN IP, by design (`routes._agent_endpoint_for()` always returns the loopback panel address for Claude Code). If Codex or pi.dev requests fail auth after changing `router_host`, make sure `LLAMAFORGE_API_KEY` (Codex) or the embedded `apiKey` (pi) actually matches the current `router_api_key` in config — a stale key set before you edited config will keep failing. If re-applying a config seems to have no effect, check `<path>.llamaforge.bak` next to the target file: it holds the original from before LlamaForge ever touched it, since the backup is only ever written once.

See also [Context Wiki](context-wiki.md) for how injected context reaches requests that go through the shim or router proxy.
