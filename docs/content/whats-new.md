# What's New

This page summarizes the most recent additions to LlamaForge. Each entry links to the full reference for that capability. For the longer-term direction, see the project's `ROADMAP.md`.

## Unreleased (early preview)

These are on `master` and not in a tagged release yet.

- **Several models at once.** Multi-model mode places your main model on the fastest GPU that fits it and keeps worker models off that GPU. Fit is checked against footprints measured on this machine, and each verdict says whether it's measured, predicted or a rough estimate. Workers are evicted least-recently-used, and only after you agree to it. A model with no context size set is refused, with the reason. The model rows get **Load as worker**, **Make main** and **Unload X and load**, and Setup has a Multi-model card. API: `/api/slots`, `/api/slots/plan`, `/api/slots/main`, `/api/slots/apply`.
- **Per-model builds.** Pin a model to any installed llama.cpp build. An ik_llama build runs as its own `llama-server` on `127.0.0.1:8100` and up, with arguments translated between the builds. Crash exit codes are named instead of shown as raw numbers.
- **"Runs on" for GGUFs.** The file card says whether a GGUF runs on any build, mainline only or ik_llama only. The diagnosis explains `invalid ggml type N` instead of leaving you with the number.
- **Embers.** Small local agents that keep watch on a topic, keep a wiki and write you a brief on a schedule. A wiki item only counts if it quotes its source verbatim. Model Scout needs no setup, and **Forge** builds a new ember by interviewing you (tested on 8 models from 3B to 27B). See [Embers](embers.md).
- **MCP server.** Claude Code, Codex or any MCP client can check status, load and unload models, check fit, search and download from Hugging Face, and hand a task to a local model. See [MCP Server](mcp.md).
- **pi from Setup.** The pi coding agent card installs, updates and removes pi under `<root>/agents/pi` (with `--ignore-scripts`), and can install Node.js through winget, Chocolatey or Homebrew. See [Connect an Agent](agents.md).
- **Stowage, the new default look.** Each GPU on Models is drawn as a cargo hold ruled in 1 GiB cells, with every loaded model stowed in it at its measured size. Open a model and it shows where it would go: if it won't fit, the part that doesn't fit hangs past the end of the hold and anything that would be unloaded is marked. A ledger adds up used, booked and free to the tenth. Light, dark and colorblind-safe. **Hearth** and **Classic** are one click away. Motion is subtle, never runs on the views that refresh every few seconds, and is off when your system asks for reduced motion. See [Theming & Accessibility](theming.md).
- **No font CDN.** The panel's fonts ship with it, so it renders the same offline and no third party learns you opened it.
- **Stats count every loaded model**, including models running as their own process, with live tokens per second for each. See [Stats](stats.md).
- **Docs search reads the whole page**, not only titles and headings, and says so when nothing matches.

## v0.15: llama.cpp sizes memory, honest diagnosis, safer by default

- **llama.cpp's `--fit` decides context, GPU layers and split.** LlamaForge no longer pins `ctx-size`, `n-gpu-layers` or `tensor-split`. Auto-tune clears them, and the old `[*] ctx-size = 150000` pin is removed once on upgrade. See [First Run](first-run.md) and [models.ini Format](models-ini.md).
- **Load failures quote the attempt that failed.** The diagnosis reads only the last load of that model from the router log and quotes llama.cpp's own error line. If a value you pinned turned fit off, the out-of-memory hint names it. See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).
- **Split GGUFs count all their shards** in sizes and fit estimates. Speed and fit badges are labelled as rough estimates.
- **A download ends in Load & Chat**, and a first run with no models suggests starters sized to your VRAM.
- **Security:** the router always runs with an API key, and CORS is localhost-only unless you opt into LAN. Recipes import only allowlisted tuning knobs. `stop` and uninstall touch only processes and files LlamaForge owns. Vulnerabilities can be reported privately (see `SECURITY.md`).
- The running version is shown next to the logo and requested in bug reports.

## Community recipe gallery

Click **browse recipes** on the Profiles strip to see tested setups people have shared: the model, the hardware it ran on, what the key knobs do, and an **on this machine** badge when you already have the file. **Import** runs the normal recipe import, so a missing model downloads from Hugging Face and the same knob filter applies. The list comes live from the repo's `recipes/` folder, so a merged recipe appears without a release; offline, LlamaForge shows the copy that shipped with your version. To add yours, export it with ↗ and open a pull request (see `recipes/README.md`).

See [Models & Tuning](models.md) and [HTTP API](api.md).

## Shareable recipes

Any llama.cpp profile can be shared as a **recipe**: click ↗ on its chip and copy readable JSON with the model file, the Hugging Face repo it came from, its knobs, and the llama.cpp build it was made on. Paste a recipe into **+ import recipe** to get the same preset and profile. If you don't have the model, **Download & import** fetches it. Only tuning knobs are imported; paths, hosts, keys and logging flags are always dropped.

See [Models & Tuning](models.md) and [HTTP API](api.md).

## One-click launch profiles

Save a model, a preset, and (optionally) a specific installed llama.cpp build as a named **profile** from the model's editor, then launch the whole combination from a ▶ chip above the model list. If the pinned build isn't the active one, LlamaForge switches to it, waits for the router, applies the preset, and loads the model. That's useful when a new llama.cpp release regresses one model and you want to keep it on the build that worked. Builds a profile pins are kept out of the automatic pruning after an update.

See [Models & Tuning](models.md) and [HTTP API](api.md).

## Focused scanning and a lighter Models tab

Setup can now persist one or more model folders instead of walking every drive, while an explicit blank list still selects the platform defaults. A llama.cpp model can be **Unregistered** from `models.ini` without deleting its GGUF file. The Models view also avoids polling collapsed logs, shares GPU telemetry through a short cache instead of spawning `nvidia-smi` per browser poll, and keeps the CRT scanline look without the expensive full-viewport blend mode.

Fresh bootstrap runs now accept an existing llama.cpp checkout and derive its build/server paths, removing the hand-edit step reported by WSL2 users.

See [Setup](setup.md), [Models & Tuning](models.md), and [Install](install.md).

## Fail-closed network and explicit credentials

Network Access now distinguishes the loopback-only dashboard from the router it
controls. LlamaForge accepts only local (`127.0.0.1`) or LAN (`0.0.0.0`) router
scope, requires a usable key for every newly configured LAN router, and refuses
LlamaForge-owned starts/restarts when that policy is unsafe. Existing manual or
legacy settings are shown for repair rather than silently rewritten. Routine
dashboard state is redacted; Client Config, Agent Config, and generated keys are
deliberate no-store actions. This is tested product behavior in an early preview,
not a formal security standard or audit certification.

See [Security](https://github.com/dadwritestech/LlamaForge/blob/master/SECURITY.md),
[Setup](setup.md), [HTTP API](api.md), and [Connect an Agent](agents.md).

## ik_llama as a second llama-family engine

The Build tab now builds and drives **ik_llama.cpp** alongside stock llama.cpp, switched with one control (`POST /api/engine/switch`). The switch is gated on a capability probe: a binary whose `llama-server` lacks router mode (`--models-preset`) is refused with an explanation rather than taking the router down, and ik_llama keeps its own `models.ini` registry (a `-ikllama` sibling of the main one). Per-model tuning comes along automatically because the knob schema is parsed from whichever binary is active.

See [Build & Update](build.md) and [models.ini Format](models-ini.md).

## Bind a preset as a model's default

Named presets can now be **bound** to a model, not just applied once. Binding writes the preset's knobs into the model's section and — the point of it — editing a bound preset re-syncs every model using it. A ◉/○ dot on each preset chip toggles the binding; the bound chip is highlighted. Hand edits still win, and unbinding leaves the knobs in place.

See [Models & Tuning](models.md).

## Auto-wired MTP draft models

A scan now attaches an `mtp-*` speculative draft sidecar to its parent model the way `mmproj` already is, filling `spec-draft-model`. It enables `spec-type=draft-mtp` only when the sidecar actually declares NextN layers — the signal llama.cpp itself gates on — so a model that can't use MTP is never broken. The wiring is additive: it never overwrites a `spec-type` you set by hand (e.g. an ngram mode).

See [models.ini Format](models-ini.md).

## Offload-aware VRAM-fit rating

The **FITS / TIGHT / CPU OFFLOAD** badge in Discover now defers to the same physics estimate as the Will-it-run panel instead of a raw size-vs-VRAM guess. A large MoE that runs fast with its experts on CPU reads as **TIGHT** rather than being mislabeled **CPU OFFLOAD** just for being bigger than VRAM. The size heuristic remains the fallback when no prediction is available.

See [Discover](discover.md).

## A more forgiving first run

Several fresh-install rough edges are gone. A missing `config.json` is seeded from `config.example.json` instead of crashing; `models.ini` is created if absent; a relative `models_ini` resolves against the repo root so the router never comes up with zero models; a busy router port is reported by name instead of failing silently; a freshly installed tool is detected without a restart; and a build whose `llama-server` succeeded but whose UI-asset step failed reports **"built, with warnings"** instead of BUILD FAILED.

See [First Run](first-run.md), [Setup](setup.md), and [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).

## Lite and Advanced modes, with a guided first run

A first-run wizard now walks a new install through engine detection, hardware review, model selection, and a recommended tune — then applies it and loads the model. The dashboard runs in one of two modes: **Lite** presents a reduced, task-oriented set of controls; **Advanced** exposes every server flag. A hardware **auto-tune** proposes per-model settings (GPU-layer offload, KV-cache type, context ceiling, and intent presets for balanced / speed / context / coding) sized to the detected VRAM.

See [First Run](first-run.md) and [Models & Tuning](models.md).

## Anthropic-compatible endpoint

The panel exposes an Anthropic-compatible `POST /v1/messages` endpoint that translates to the local OpenAI-style router, with full streaming and tool-use support. Combined with the existing OpenAI-compatible surface, LlamaForge can serve clients written for either API against your local models.

See [HTTP API](api.md).

## One-click agent setup

A **Connect an Agent** panel generates — and optionally writes — the configuration for **Claude Code**, **Codex**, and **pi.dev**, pointing each at your local endpoint. Claude Code is scoped to `127.0.0.1`; generated files are backed up before any change is written.

See [Connect an Agent](agents.md).

## Context Wiki

A working directory of Markdown context documents, composed into named **profiles** and selected **per model**. An active profile is delivered two ways: injected into requests through the Anthropic shim and the OpenAI proxy, or exported into an agent's native context file (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`) inside a managed marker region. Because the injected prefix is stable, the router's prompt-cache reuses it across requests.

See [Context Wiki](context-wiki.md).

## Light and dark themes, plus a colorblind-safe mode

The dashboard now offers a **Light** theme alongside the original dark one, and an independent **Colorblind-safe** mode that applies a universal Okabe–Ito status palette and adds non-color cues (glyphs and labels) so status never depends on hue alone. The two axes are orthogonal — all four combinations are valid — and each choice persists per device.

See [Theming & Accessibility](theming.md).

## In-app documentation

The documentation you are reading is available inside the dashboard under the **Help** view and is also published as a static site. Both surfaces render from a single Markdown source, so they never drift.

## A collapsible sidebar layout

Navigation moved from a top tab bar to a left **sidebar** that collapses between a compact icon rail and a labeled, expanded state. Settings are pinned at the bottom; the layout adapts to narrow windows with an overlay drawer. All existing navigation, theming, and keyboard shortcuts are unchanged.

See [Keyboard Shortcuts](keymap.md).

## Refine benchmark in the Models panel

A **Refine** button now sits inline in each model's editor (beside the Presets bar). Pick an intent (balanced / speed / context / coding), click **Run**, and it auto-generates knob recommendations, benchmarks candidates with real completion requests (~200 tokens each), and applies the fastest config. A results table shows tok/s per candidate and which was chosen. The same autotune engine used in the first-run wizard is now available anytime from the main Models tab.

See [Models & Tuning](models.md).

## VRAM "Will-it-run" panel

Before downloading, the **Discover** tab now shows a **Will-it-run** panel that predicts whether a model quant will fit your GPU and at what approximate speed. It factors in MoE active-vs-total parameters, your GPU's memory bandwidth (with manual overrides in Setup), and the quant's size — then rates it as **FITS**, **TIGHT**, or **CPU OFFLOAD** with an estimated tok/s. The same estimate appears as a badge when you expand a model in Discover.

See [Discover](discover.md).
