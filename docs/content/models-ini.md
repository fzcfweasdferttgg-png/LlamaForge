# models.ini Format

`models.ini` is an INI file passed straight to `llama-server` via `--models-preset <path>` (see `backend/router_ctl.py` `start()`). LlamaForge never translates it into a different format for the router — the dashboard reads and rewrites it directly (`backend/config.py` `read_sections()` / `set_keys()`), and `llama-server` parses it itself when the router starts. `config.json`'s `models_ini` key points at the file (default: `<repo root>/models.ini`).

The file is created for you if it's absent: `config.ensure_models_ini()` runs on startup (and both launch scripts do the same before starting the router) and writes a minimal file with a `[*]` section, because `llama-server` refuses to start without one. A **relative** `models_ini` (the shipped default is `./models.ini`) is anchored to the repo root before it's handed to the detached router, so launching from another directory can't point the router at an empty registry. When the active engine is **ik_llama**, a separate `-ikllama` sibling registry is used (e.g. `models-ikllama.ini`, or whatever `ik_llama_models_ini` points at), since the two binaries accept different flags — see [Build & Update](build.md).

## Format

- One `[section]` per model. The section name is the model's id, used everywhere in the UI and API (`/api/load`, `/api/unload`, the `model` field in `/v1/messages` and `/v1/chat/completions`).
- An optional `[*]` section holds global defaults applied to every model that doesn't override them.
- Keys inside a section are `key = value` lines. A key name is the corresponding `llama-server` command-line flag with the leading `--` stripped and remaining dashes kept — `ctx-size` is `--ctx-size`, `n-cpu-moe` is `--n-cpu-moe`.
- `;` starts an inline or full-line comment; `config.read_sections()` strips it before returning values.
- The file must not carry a BOM — `_write()` in `backend/config.py` always writes without one, and sections are read with `encoding="utf-8-sig"` so a BOM left by another editor is tolerated on read but never re-added on write.

## Real example

From the project's own `models.ini`:

```ini
[*]

[qwen3.6-35b-a3b-ud-q4-k-xl]
model = D:/models/LlamaForge-downloads/unsloth--Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MTP-GGUF/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf
mmproj = D:/models/LlamaForge-downloads/unsloth--Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MTP-GGUF/mmproj-F16.gguf
n-cpu-moe = 37

[qwen3-coder-next-q4-k-m]
model = D:/models/lmstudio-community/Qwen3-Coder-Next-GGUF/Qwen3-Coder-Next-Q4_K_M.gguf

[gpt-oss-20b-mxfp4]
model = D:/models/lmstudio-community/gpt-oss-20b-GGUF/gpt-oss-20b-MXFP4.gguf
ctx-size = 100000
```

`qwen3-coder-next-q4-k-m` has no `ctx-size`, so llama.cpp's `--fit` picks the largest context that fits the free VRAM when it loads. `gpt-oss-20b-mxfp4` pins `ctx-size = 100000`, which switches fit off for that model. `qwen3.6-35b-a3b-ud-q4-k-xl` adds `mmproj` (a multimodal projector file) and `n-cpu-moe` (MoE experts offloaded to CPU) on top of `model`.

## Common keys

| Key | Maps to | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | `--model` | Path to the GGUF model file. Required per section. |
| `mmproj` | `--mmproj` | Path to a multimodal projector GGUF, for vision-capable models. |
| `ctx-size` | `--ctx-size` | Context window size, in tokens. |
| `n-cpu-moe` | `--n-cpu-moe` | Number of MoE expert layers offloaded to CPU (mixed CPU/GPU inference for MoE models). |
| `embeddings` | `--embeddings` | Set to `true` to mark/run the model in embeddings mode. |
| `spec-draft-model` | `--spec-draft-model` | Path to a speculative draft model (e.g. an auto-attached `mtp-*` sidecar). |
| `spec-type` | `--spec-type` | Speculative-decoding type, e.g. `draft-mtp` or an `ngram-*` mode. |

Beyond these, any `llama-server` flag can be set as a key — the dashboard's Advanced UI mode (`ui_mode: "advanced"` in `config.json`) exposes the full set (200+ on current builds), discovered at runtime by parsing `llama-server --help` (`backend/argspec.py` `build_schema()`).

## Context size is llama.cpp's call

LlamaForge doesn't write `ctx-size`, `n-gpu-layers` or `tensor-split`. llama.cpp's `--fit` (on by default) sizes all three from the free VRAM at load; pinning any of them, globally in `[*]` or per model, turns fit off.

`config.apply_ctx_defaults()` runs on startup and only fixes an impossible value: a per-model `ctx-size` larger than the model's trained length (read from the GGUF header) is clamped to it. It never adds a `ctx-size` and never touches `[*]`. Older versions wrote `[*] ctx-size = 150000` on every startup; that pin is removed once on upgrade.

## Auto-wired MTP draft models

When a scan finds an `mtp-*` GGUF next to a model, it attaches it the way `mmproj` is attached: the sibling's path is written as `spec-draft-model` on the parent section. It additionally sets `spec-type = draft-mtp` **only** when the sidecar declares NextN layers (`gguf.has_nextn()` — the property llama.cpp gates MTP on), so a sidecar the current build can't use is attached but left inert rather than breaking the load. This wiring is **additive**: because `spec-type` is also how you select `ngram-*` speculation, a re-scan never overwrites a `spec-type` (or `spec-draft-model`) you already set by hand.

## Editing

Prefer the dashboard over hand-editing: `POST /api/save` (per-model knobs) and the scan/download flows call `config.set_keys()`, which updates or removes individual keys in place while preserving comments and the position of every other line. Hand edits are safe too — `read_sections()` is tolerant of blank lines, comments, and section order.

See also [config.json Reference](config.md) for the `models_ini` path setting, and [HTTP API](api.md) for the endpoints that read and mutate this file.
