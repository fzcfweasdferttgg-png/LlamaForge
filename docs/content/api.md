# HTTP API

The LlamaForge dashboard backend (`backend/server.py`) listens on `panel_port` (default `8090`) and serves the web UI, the `/api/*` management API, and two agent-facing, provider-compatible chat endpoints. The `/api/*` routes below are the `GET_ROUTES` and `POST_ROUTES` tables in `backend/routes.py`; `backend/server.py` holds the HTTP handler and serves `/v1/messages`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/web/*` and `/docs/img/*` itself.

`/api/*` request/response bodies are JSON. Every JSON response has
`Cache-Control: no-store`.

> [!NOTE]
> If vLLM support isn't available on the host, every route is first checked by `_vllm_gate()`; requests to `/api/vllm/*` paths return an error response instead of reaching the normal handler.

## Agent-facing endpoints

These are the endpoints external coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) talk to — see `backend/agentsetup.py` for the config generators that point agents at them.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages API-compatible endpoint. Requires `anthropic_shim_enabled: true` in `config.json` (the default) and uses conditional `_shim_auth_ok`: auth is skipped for local router scope (and current behavior also skips when no key is configured); when enforced, it accepts either `x-api-key` or `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Supports `"stream": true` (SSE) via `_anthropic_stream`, translates to the OpenAI-shaped request, and forwards to the router. |
| POST | `/v1/messages/count_tokens` | Anthropic-compatible token-count estimate for a would-be `/v1/messages` request. Same enable and conditional auth behavior as `/v1/messages`. |
| POST | `/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI Chat Completions-compatible endpoint with the same conditional `_shim_auth_ok` behavior. Injects the active wiki context profile as a system message (`_inject_openai_system`) before forwarding to the router. Supports `"stream": true`. |
| POST | `/api/load` | Load a model into the router. Body: `{"model": "<id>"}`. Proxies to the router's `/models/load`. With multi-model on, the body also takes `role` (`main` or `worker`) and `evict`, and the load goes through the placement planner; a refusal comes back with a `reason`. |
| POST | `/api/unload` | Unload a model from the router. Body: `{"model": "<id>"}`. Proxies to the router's `/models/unload`. |
| POST | `/api/unload_all` | Unload every currently loaded/loading model (except the router's `default` entry). |

## Model and preset management

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/state` | Dashboard state: models (llama.cpp + vLLM merged), GPU telemetry, platform, public config projection, and onboarding status. `config` is an exact allowlist (`theme`, `cvd`, `skin`, `auto_load_model`, `vram_bandwidths`, `presets`, `preset_bindings`, `profiles`, `active_engine`) plus `router_api_key_configured`; it is not full `config.json` and never includes the key. |
| GET | `/api/schema` | The knob schema (available `llama-server` flags), built from `llama-server --help`. |
| POST | `/api/save` | Save per-model knob overrides into `models.ini` (`config.set_keys`). Reloads the running model if it was loaded. |
| POST | `/api/models/unregister` | Remove a llama-family model from its `models.ini` registry without deleting the GGUF. Body: `{model, backend}`. Unloads it first when necessary. |
| GET | `/api/presets` | List saved knob presets from `config.json`. |
| POST | `/api/presets/save` | Save a named knob preset. |
| POST | `/api/presets/delete` | Delete a named preset. |
| POST | `/api/presets/apply` | Apply a saved preset's knobs to a model, same reload behavior as `/api/save`. |
| POST | `/api/profiles/save` | Save a launch profile: `{name, profile: {model, backend, preset, engine}}`. `engine` is an install directory name under `engines/llama.cpp` (blank = active build). |
| POST | `/api/profiles/delete` | Delete a launch profile (the model and its settings stay). |
| POST | `/api/profiles/launch` | Launch a profile: switch to its pinned build if needed, apply its preset, load its model. Returns `{ok, step, error, switched_engine, model}`. |
| POST | `/api/profiles/export` | A profile as a shareable recipe `{llamaforge_recipe: 1, name, model, settings, engine}`. Paths, hosts and keys are never included. |
| GET | `/api/recipes/gallery` | Community recipes `{source: "github"\|"bundled", recipes: [{id, title, hardware, author, notes, model, settings, engine, dropped, have, recipe}]}`. `recipe` is ready to POST to `/api/profiles/import`. `?force=1` skips the 6 h cache. |
| POST | `/api/profiles/import` | Import a recipe `{recipe, download?}`. Creates a preset and profile, or returns `{missing}` when the model isn't here; `download: true` starts fetching it from the recipe's Hugging Face repo. Unsafe or unknown knobs come back in `dropped`. |
| POST | `/api/presets/bind` | Bind a preset as a model's default (materializes its knobs; `name: ""` unbinds). Re-saving a bound preset re-syncs every model using it. |
| GET | `/api/model/metadata` | GGUF metadata for a model id (query param `model`). |
| GET | `/api/model/diag` | Diagnostic read of the router log against a model's merged (`[*]` + per-model) settings (query param `model`). |
| POST | `/api/autotune/recommend` | Recommend knob values for a model given hardware constraints. Body: `{model, intent}` where `intent` is `balanced`, `speed`, `context`, or `coding`. Returns `{knobs, reasons}`. |
| POST | `/api/autotune/refine` | Auto-generate knob recommendations, benchmark candidates with real completion requests (~200 tokens), and return the fastest config. Body: `{model, intent}` (knobs optional; generated if omitted). Returns `{knobs, measurements: {candidates: [{knobs, tok_s}], chosen_tok_s}}`. |
| GET | `/api/scan/missing` | List `models.ini` entries whose GGUF file no longer exists on disk. |
| POST | `/api/scan` | Scan directories for GGUF files. Body `roots` overrides saved `model_dirs`; explicit `roots: []` selects platform defaults. |
| POST | `/api/scan/apply` | Register scanned entries into `models.ini` and reapply ctx-size defaults. |
| POST | `/api/scan/prune` | Remove `models.ini` sections whose file is missing (unloading first if loaded). |

## Build, setup, and hardware

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/setup` | Prerequisite tool status (git/cmake/ninja/compiler/CUDA) plus hardware recommendation. |
| POST | `/api/setup/install` | Install a missing prerequisite tool (Windows/macOS only). |
| GET | `/api/gpus` | GPU telemetry via a shared 10-second cache (`nvidia-smi`, or the kernel's DRM sysfs when it is absent). |
| GET | `/api/build/info` | Current commit, available updates, and recommended/saved CMake flags (per `target`: `llamacpp` or `ikllama`). |
| GET | `/api/build/log` | Tail of the build log plus builder state (`phase` includes `done_warnings` for a partial success). |
| POST | `/api/build/start` | Start (re)building the target engine with the given (or saved/recommended) CMake flags. |
| POST | `/api/engine/switch` | Point the router at `llamacpp` or `ikllama` (sets `active_engine`); refused if the target binary has no router mode. |
| GET | `/api/engine/prebuilt` | Installed official llama.cpp builds, which one is active, and the latest release on a channel (`?channel=`, `?force=1` to skip the cache). |
| GET | `/api/engine/prebuilt/status` | Progress and log tail of a prebuilt download/install. |
| POST | `/api/engine/prebuilt/install` | Download and install the latest official build for your GPU. Body: `channel`, optional `variant`. |
| POST | `/api/engine/prebuilt/cancel` | Cancel a running prebuilt install. |
| POST | `/api/engine/prebuilt/use` | Switch to an already-installed build (rollback). Body: `dir`, which must be one `/api/engine/prebuilt` lists. |
| GET | `/api/starters` | Starter-model suggestions sized to your total VRAM. |
| GET | `/api/feed` | "New this week": architectures llama.cpp just merged, marked against your engine build, plus whether a newer LlamaForge release is out. |
| GET | `/api/app/update` | Progress of a LlamaForge self-update. |
| POST | `/api/app/update` | Update LlamaForge to a release. Body: `tag`. |
| POST | `/api/app/restart` | Restart the panel after a finished self-update. |

## VRAM prediction

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/vram/predict` | Rough estimate of whether a model quant fits your GPU and how fast it might run. JSON body: `repo` (HF repo id, required), `quant` (default `q4_k_m`), optional `gguf_file`. The size comes from the matching GGUF file (all shards). Returns `{regime, tok_s, model_size_bytes, active_size_bytes}`. Accounts for MoE active-vs-total parameters and GPU memory bandwidth (with Setup overrides); treat `tok_s` as a ballpark. |

## Model Hub (download)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/hub/search` | Search Hugging Face for GGUF repos, annotated with what's already installed. |
| POST | `/api/hub/files` | List a repo's files/quantizations, sized against available VRAM. |
| POST | `/api/hub/download` | Start downloading a model (and optional mmproj) from the Hub. |
| GET | `/api/hub/progress` | Current download progress. |
| POST | `/api/hub/cancel` / `/api/hub/pause` / `/api/hub/resume` | Control the active download. |
| POST | `/api/hub/add` | Register a finished manual/download-dir GGUF into `models.ini`. |

## Network and router control

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/network` | Redacted Network Access status: canonical/legacy access scope, configured host and security/key status, key-present boolean, remediation message, configured port and LAN IP, plus `router_running`/`listener_status`. A listening port is observation only, not process-identity or authentication verification. |
| POST | `/api/network` | Save a canonical Network Access request and restart the router. Body: `{access_scope: "local"|"lan", key_action: "keep"|"generate"|"replace"|"clear", api_key?: "..."}`. `replace` requires a strong replacement; `clear` is local-only; LAN has no unauthenticated path. For one release, the old `{host, api_key}` shape is accepted only for canonical hosts. A generated key is returned only as `generated_api_key` to that explicit request. Results distinguish saved configuration from `restart_status` (`running`, `starting`, or `failed`) and listener observation. |
| POST | `/api/client/config` | Deliberately generate client snippets for `{model, backend}`. llama-family output may contain the router key; active vLLM output does not. Unknown, ambiguous, or unloaded vLLM targets are rejected. |
| GET | `/api/router/log` | Tail of the router's log. |
| GET | `/api/stats` | Usage stats summary. |
| POST | `/api/stats/reset` | Reset usage stats. |
| POST | `/api/config` | Merge an allowlisted subset of user-facing settings into `config.json` (the list is in [config.json Reference](config.md)); other keys are refused and named in the response. Changing `multi_model`, `slot_cap` or `slot_autoload` restarts a running router, and the response's `router` field says whether it did. |

> [!NOTE]
> There is no `GET /api/config` route; current config is read via `GET /api/state`'s `config` field instead.

## Multi-model, per-model builds, pi, and MCP setup

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/slots` | Multi-model pool state: `enabled`, `multi_model`, the router's running `pool`, `restart_needed` (the setting is on but the running router was started single), the `main` model and the `loaded` list. |
| GET | `/api/slots/plan` | Where a model would go if loaded: query `model` (required) and `role` (`worker` by default). Returns the verdict a load would get now (whether it fits and what would be evicted) without loading anything. |
| POST | `/api/slots/main` | Set the pool's main model: `{model}` (`""` clears it). |
| POST | `/api/slots/apply` | Restart the router with the pool the current settings ask for. Returns `{ok, restarted, error}`. |
| POST | `/api/model/build` | Pin a model to an installed build: `{model, build}`; `build: ""` runs it on the router's own build. A model that is up is unloaded first. Returns `{ok, build, changed, was_running}`. |
| GET | `/api/pi/status` | The pi coding agent: Node.js version against the minimum, whether LlamaForge has its own copy (`managed`), which pi is `active`, whether a job is `busy`, and the `last` result. |
| POST | `/api/pi/install` / `/api/pi/remove` | Start a pi install (or update) or removal job; progress comes back through `GET /api/pi/status`. `409` if a job is already running. |
| GET | `/api/mcp/setup` | Ready-to-paste client configs for LlamaForge's [MCP server](mcp.md), with this install's Python and script paths filled in. |

## Embers

The Embers tab's endpoints. See [Embers](embers.md) for what each does.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/embers` | Every ember as a card, the embers folder, and whether the scheduler is running. |
| GET | `/api/embers/templates` | The templates a new ember can start from. |
| GET | `/api/embers/brief` | An ember's brief: query `id`, optional `date`. |
| GET | `/api/embers/pages` | An ember's wiki pages and recent source snapshots (query `id`). |
| GET | `/api/embers/page` | One wiki page rendered (query `id`, `page`). |
| GET | `/api/embers/raw` | One source snapshot (query `id`, `sha`). |
| GET | `/api/embers/log` | Recent job runs and log lines (query `id`). |
| POST | `/api/embers/create` | Create an ember from a template: `{template, bindings, id?}`. |
| POST | `/api/embers/update` | Change `name`, `bindings`, `jobs`, `model`, `enabled` or `push` for `{id}`. |
| POST | `/api/embers/delete` | Remove an ember: `{id}`. Its wiki stays on disk; the response's `kept` is the folder. `409` while a job is running. |
| POST | `/api/embers/run` | Queue `{id, job}` where `job` is `run` (ingest then brief), `ingest`, `brief` or `lint`. |
| POST | `/api/embers/cancel` | Drop an ember's queued jobs: `{id}`. |
| POST | `/api/embers/ask` | Ask an ember's wiki a question: `{id, question}`. Uses a model that is already loaded. |
| POST | `/api/embers/forge` | One turn of the Forge interview that builds an ember. Uses a model that is already loaded. |
| POST | `/api/embers/push/test` | Send a test notification through an ember's push settings: `{id}`. |
| POST | `/api/embers/folder` | Point the panel at another embers folder: `{path}` (`""` = the default). Nothing is moved. |

## vLLM (WSL) management

Only reachable when vLLM support is available on the host (`_vllm_gate`).

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/vllm/setup` | vLLM/WSL install status plus any running setup job. |
| POST | `/api/vllm/setup/install` | Kick off the vLLM install script inside WSL. |
| POST | `/api/vllm/update` | Run the vLLM update script inside WSL. |
| GET | `/api/vllm/log` | Tail of the vLLM process log. |
| GET | `/api/vllm/schema` | vLLM knob schema. |
| GET | `/api/vllm/version` | Installed vs. latest PyPI vLLM version. |
| POST | `/api/vllm/load` / `/api/vllm/unload` | Load/unload a registered vLLM model. |
| POST | `/api/vllm/save` | Save a vLLM model's settings, restarting it if currently running. |
| POST | `/api/vllm/hub/search` | Search Hugging Face for vLLM-servable repos. |
| POST | `/api/vllm/hub/info` | Repo info sized against available VRAM. |
| POST | `/api/vllm/hub/download` | Start a vLLM model download. |
| GET | `/api/vllm/hub/progress` | Download progress. |
| POST | `/api/vllm/hub/register` | Register a downloaded model into the vLLM registry. |
| POST | `/api/vllm/delete` | Delete a downloaded vLLM model and deregister it. |

## Agent config and context wiki

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/agent/config` | Deliberately preview connection config for `{agent, model, backend, small, inject}`. It is POST-only; the active llama-family backend is required and vLLM is rejected. |
| POST | `/api/agent/apply` | Write agent config on the dashboard machine using the same targeting fields (`agent`, `model`, `backend`, `small`, `inject`). It may use the stored key internally but never returns a key. |
| GET | `/api/wiki/docs` | List context-wiki documents. |
| GET | `/api/wiki/doc` | Read a single document (query param `name`). |
| POST | `/api/wiki/doc` | Create/update a document. |
| POST | `/api/wiki/doc/delete` | Delete a document. |
| GET | `/api/wiki/profiles` | List saved context profiles. |
| POST | `/api/wiki/profile` | Save a named profile (its doc list + description). |
| POST | `/api/wiki/profile/delete` | Delete a profile. |
| GET | `/api/wiki/preview` | Preview the composed text for a profile (query param `profile`). |
| POST | `/api/wiki/active` | Set the active profile for a model. |
| POST | `/api/wiki/export` | Export composed context (e.g. to an agent's own file format). |

## Docs viewer

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/docs` | Manifest of documentation pages (sections/order/titles). |
| GET | `/api/docs/page` | Rendered HTML for one page (query param `slug`); 404 if the slug doesn't exist. |
| GET | `/docs/img/<name>` | Serve an image referenced from a docs page, path-safety-checked by `docs._safe_img`. |

## Static / UI

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/` or `/index.html` | The dashboard's single HTML page. |
| GET | `/web/js/<name>.js` | A frontend ES module. Confined to `web/`; anything outside 404s. |

## Engine-agnostic model verbs

These dispatch on the model's own backend, so the same call works for a
llama.cpp GGUF and a vLLM safetensors repo. The body takes an optional
`backend` hint (`"llamacpp"` / `"vllm"`); without it the id is looked up.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/models/load` | Load `{model}` on whichever engine owns it. |
| POST | `/api/models/unload` | Unload `{model}`. |
| POST | `/api/models/save` | Persist `{settings}` and apply them (restarting the process if that engine has no hot reload). |
| POST | `/api/models/delete` | Delete the model's files, where the engine supports it (vLLM only; llama.cpp returns 400). |

The engine-specific paths (`/api/load`, `/api/vllm/load`, …) remain as aliases.

## Request requirements

The dashboard binds `127.0.0.1` (or `panel_host` when it leaves the loopback),
which keeps it off your network by default but leaves it reachable by any page
in your browser. Every request is therefore checked:

- `Host` must name this service - the loopback names, plus this machine's own
  LAN names when `panel_host` is shared - and `Origin`, when present, must
  match it. Anything else gets **403**. This blocks both cross-site requests and
  DNS rebinding.
- When a POST declares `Content-Type`, it must be `application/json`; declared
  form or other non-JSON content types get **415**, helping block a cross-site
  `<form>`. This guard currently permits an absent `Content-Type`.
- Every POST requires exactly one ASCII-decimal `Content-Length`. Missing length
  is **411**. Malformed, duplicate, or transfer-encoded framing is **400**; a
  short body is also **400**. Rejected framing closes the connection.
- Management POSTs are limited to 4 MiB. `/v1/messages` and
  `/v1/chat/completions` use a 64 MiB inference-proxy limit. A body over its
  route-class limit is **413** before it is read or dispatched.
- `POST /api/config` only accepts an allowlist of user-facing keys (the list is in [config.json Reference](config.md)). See
  [Security](https://github.com/dadwritestech/LlamaForge/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

See also [config.json Reference](config.md) for the settings `/api/config` and `/api/network` write, and [models.ini Format](models-ini.md) for the file `/api/save`, `/api/scan/apply`, `/api/scan/prune`, and `/api/hub/add` mutate.
