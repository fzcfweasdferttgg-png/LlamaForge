# Setup

Check build prerequisites, install what is missing with your permission, scan your drives for GGUF models already on disk, and prune registry entries whose files are gone.

## What it does

The Setup tab is a column of cards. The four described first (prerequisites, installing missing tools, drive scan, registry prune) each have their own backend module; the cards for [Network Access](#network-access), [Connect an Agent](#connect-an-agent), multi-model, speed estimates and vLLM follow below.

**Prerequisite detection.** `backend/prereqs.py` checks for four command-line tools — `git`, `cmake`, `ninja`, and `python` (via `shutil.which`, running `--version` to confirm and capture the installed version) — plus the platform C++ compiler and the CUDA toolkit. On Windows, the compiler check (`find_msvc()`) shells out to `vswhere.exe` to locate an MSVC install with the C++ desktop workload, falling back to a glob for `cl.exe` under `Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio`. On macOS/Linux it looks for `clang++` or `g++` on `PATH`. CUDA detection reads `nvcc --version` (or `$CUDA_PATH`) and is skipped entirely on macOS, where Metal is used instead.

**Installing missing tools.** Which package manager runs depends on the OS, verified directly in `prereqs.py`:

- **Windows:** `install()` tries `winget install --id <pkg> -e --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements` first; if `winget` isn't on `PATH` or the install fails, it falls back to `choco install <pkg> -y`.
- **macOS:** `install()` requires Homebrew and runs `brew install <pkg>` — no `sudo` needed.
- **Linux:** the dashboard never runs `sudo`. `install()` returns `ok=False` with the exact command to paste into a terminal (`sudo apt-get install -y <pkg>`, `sudo dnf install -y <pkg>`, or `sudo pacman -S --noconfirm <pkg>`, picked by `osplat.linux_pkg_manager()` probing `apt-get` → `dnf` → `pacman` in that order).

Each tool in `prereqs.TOOLS` carries its own `winget`/`choco`/`brew`/`pkg` identifiers and a fallback download URL, used whichever path applies. `_can_auto_install()` gates the **Install** button: on Windows it needs `winget` or `choco` present; on macOS it needs `brew`; on Linux the button never appears — only the hint.

After a successful install, the running process's `PATH` is refreshed from the registry (`osplat.refresh_path()`, Windows-only) and the tool is re-probed, so a freshly installed `ninja` or `cmake` is detected immediately. Only if it still isn't visible does the result ask you to restart LlamaForge — the old behavior (always MISSING until a restart) is gone.

**Folder or drive scan for GGUFs.** `backend/scanner.py`'s `scan()` (via `POST /api/scan`) walks the folders entered in Setup, one path per line. Saving the list persists it as `model_dirs`; clearing it restores the platform defaults. Those defaults are every fixed drive letter on Windows (`GetLogicalDrives` + `GetDriveTypeW == DRIVE_FIXED`, so removable/network drives are excluded), `$HOME` plus `/Volumes` on macOS, and `$HOME` plus any of `/mnt`, `/media`, `/srv`, `/data` on Linux. The scanner finds `.gguf` files at least 50 MB while skipping recycle bins, `.git`, and `.trash` folders. Multi-shard GGUF sets collapse to their first shard, `mmproj*` files attach to a sibling model of a known vision architecture instead of appearing standalone, `mtp-*` speculative draft sidecars attach as a `spec-draft-model` (see [models.ini Format](models-ini.md)), and files with `embed` in the name are flagged as embedding endpoints. Confirmed results are written into `models.ini` via `POST /api/scan/apply`.

**Registry prune.** `POST /api/scan/prune` ("Check for deleted models") takes a list of model IDs, re-checks each one's `model` path in `models.ini` against disk, and — only for entries whose file no longer exists — unloads it from the router if currently loaded, then removes its section from `models.ini` with `config.remove_section()`. An entry whose file has reappeared since the check is left alone. This edits `models.ini` only; it never touches files on disk.

The tab also surfaces `hardware.recommend()`'s detected CPU/GPU (shared with the Build tab), lets you pick a model under **Startup** to auto-load on launch (`auto_load_model` in `config.json`), and — on Windows — the vLLM/WSL2 install flow described in [vLLM Backend](vllm.md).

**Speed Estimates.** An optional card (marked advanced) with **VRAM GB/s**, **RAM GB/s** and **Disk GB/s** fields. They override the memory-bandwidth figures behind the "Will it run?" panel and Discover's speed badges (`vram_bandwidths` in `config.json`); blank means the detected preset or default.

**Multi-model.** The **Multi-model (llama.cpp)** card turns on loading several models at once (`multi_model`), with **at most this many** (`slot_cap`, 2-4), **VRAM kept free per GPU (MiB)** (`slot_headroom_mib`) and **let client requests load models** (`slot_autoload`, which bypasses the VRAM check). Changing the switch, the count or client loading restarts the router and unloads every loaded model, so the card asks first. It needs llama.cpp: ik_llama has no router mode. See [Models & Tuning](models.md).

## How to use it

1. Open the **Setup** tab. **Prerequisites** lists Git, CMake, Ninja, Python, your C++ compiler, and CUDA (if applicable), each marked present/missing with its detected version.
2. Click **Install** next to a missing tool to install it with your OS's package manager (Windows: winget, falling back to choco; macOS: Homebrew). On Linux, copy the shown command into a terminal yourself — the dashboard never runs `sudo`.
3. Review **Detected Hardware** — your CPU and any GPUs found, shared with the Build tab's flag recommendations.
4. Under **Scan Drives for Models**, enter one folder per line and optionally click **Save folders**, then click **Scan for GGUF models**. Leave the list blank to scan all fixed drives (or `$HOME` plus mounted volumes); review the results and click **Add N models to config** to register them.
5. Click **Check for deleted models** to find registry entries whose backing file no longer exists on disk, then click **Remove N missing** to prune them.
6. Optionally pick a model under **Startup** to auto-load when LlamaForge launches.

## Network Access

The Network Access card controls the llama.cpp router, never the dashboard: the
panel and management API stay on `127.0.0.1`. Choose **This computer only** for
the router's `127.0.0.1` scope or **Devices on my local network** for its
`0.0.0.0` scope. LAN selection requires a usable key before Apply is enabled.
(The dashboard can be shared on the LAN by hand-editing `panel_host`
in `config.json`; see [config.json Reference](config.md).)

Choose one unambiguous key action: **Keep the configured key**, **Generate a new strong key**,
**Replace with a key I provide**, or **Remove the key (local-only)**. Remove is available only with local access; moving
from LAN back to local otherwise retains the key. Generating or replacing over an
existing key, and removing an existing key, each require confirmation. Rotation
warns because clients using the previous key will stop authenticating. A generated
key is returned only by that explicit Generate action: it starts masked, can be
copied without displaying plaintext, and its one-time reveal expires after 30
seconds. Retry, Done, navigation, or a Setup rerender clears the value and its
copy closure.

Older printable LAN keys are retained as `protected_legacy` so an upgrade does
not force an immediate client outage, but the card recommends rotation. Unsupported
manual hosts and LAN configurations with an absent or invalid key are displayed as
`unsafe_legacy`, not silently rewritten. Repair them by generating/replacing the
key or returning to local-only; new router starts and restarts remain blocked until
then.

Applying saves a validated safe configuration and requests a restart. The status
separates saved settings from observed listener state: a port being occupied does
not prove that it belongs to LlamaForge or enforces the expected key. If restart
fails, the saved protected configuration remains, but the router is stopped or
unverified rather than claimed as active: “A protected configuration was saved,
but the router is stopped; LAN protection is not currently active or verified.”

## Connect an Agent

Changing an agent or model selection does not fetch credentials. Press **Show
configuration** to make the explicit POST preview, then choose **Apply** only if
you want LlamaForge to write the agent's local config file. Agent setup supports
the active llama-family backend; vLLM agent setup is deferred. Context injection
for Codex and pi uses the loopback panel endpoint, so it is local-machine-only. The same card installs the pi coding agent and lists the MCP server snippets; see [Connect an Agent](agents.md) and [MCP Server](mcp.md).

## Reference

| Concept | Source | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Prereq detection | `prereqs.status()` | `git`, `cmake`, `ninja`, `python` via `shutil.which` + `--version`; C++ compiler and CUDA toolkit detected separately. |
| Windows install | `prereqs.install()` | `winget install --id <id> -e ...`, falling back to `choco install <id> -y` if winget is absent or fails. |
| macOS install | `prereqs.install()` | `brew install <pkg>` — requires Homebrew, no sudo. |
| Linux install | `prereqs.install()` | Never runs sudo; returns the exact `apt-get`/`dnf`/`pacman` command to run yourself. |
| Drive scan roots | `scanner.list_drives()` | Windows: all fixed drive letters. macOS: `$HOME` + `/Volumes`. Linux: `$HOME` + any of `/mnt`, `/media`, `/srv`, `/data` that exist. |
| Selected scan roots | `config.json: model_dirs` | One or more directories persisted from Setup. An explicit empty list selects the platform defaults. |
| GGUF discovery | `scanner.find_ggufs()` | `.gguf` files ≥ 50 MB; skips recycle bin/`.git`/`.trash`; collapses multi-shard sets; attaches `mmproj` and `mtp-*` siblings; flags `embed` files. |
| PATH refresh after install | `osplat.refresh_path()` | Windows-only; re-reads PATH from the registry so a just-installed tool is detected without a restart. |
| Registry prune | `POST /api/scan/prune` | Removes a `models.ini` section only if its `model` file no longer exists on disk; unloads it from the router first if loaded. |
| Auto-load | `config.json: auto_load_model` | Model ID to load automatically once the router is ready after launch. |

## Troubleshooting

If **Install** doesn't appear for a missing tool, no supported package manager was found for your OS (Windows without winget or choco, macOS without Homebrew) — use the tool's download URL shown next to it instead. If a Windows install reports "winget failed" then falls through to choco, check the combined output shown in the toast/log for the underlying error (often a source-agreement prompt or an already-installed conflicting version). If the drive scan finds nothing on Windows, confirm your models sit on a fixed (non-removable, non-network) drive — `list_drives()` skips those by design. If **Check for deleted models** reports an entry you know still exists, verify the `model` path in `models.ini` matches the file's real location; a moved file reads as "deleted" until you re-scan and re-apply it.

If Network Access says settings were saved but router start is not verified,
read the displayed start error and router log, then use Retry after fixing it.
The port check only observes a listener; it cannot prove listener ownership or
authentication. An `unsafe_legacy` warning means LlamaForge deliberately refused
to start/restart until the configured host and key are repaired.

See also [Build & Update](build.md) for the same hardware detection used to pick CMake flags, and [vLLM Backend](vllm.md) for the WSL2 install flow shown at the bottom of this tab on Windows.
