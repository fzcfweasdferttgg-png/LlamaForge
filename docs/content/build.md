# Build & Update

Check whether your local llama.cpp checkout is behind upstream, and rebuild it with CMake flags auto-detected for your machine's GPU and CPU — without hand-typing `cmake` commands.

## What it does

The Build tab (labelled **Build / Update** in the sidebar) does three things: installs an official prebuilt llama.cpp (no compiler), reports how your local `llama_src` checkout compares to upstream `github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp`, and shows the CMake flags this machine should build with.

**Official prebuilt builds.** On the llama.cpp target, the top card, **Engine · official llama.cpp builds**, installs a binary from `github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp` releases with no compiler or checkout needed (`backend/prebuilt.py`, `engines/llama.cpp/` under the LlamaForge folder). It picks the variant for this PC (the **variant** dropdown lists the alternatives; the default is `auto`) and a **channel**: `nightly` (every upstream merge) or `stable` (curated releases). The install is checked against GitHub's SHA-256 and test-run before the router is switched to it; the button reads **Install llama.cpp <tag>**, **Update to <tag>** or **Reinstall**, and **Check now** refreshes the lookup. Older installs stay on disk (the newest 3 are kept) and each has a **Use** button to roll back. The source-build cards below it are headed **Or build from source**.

**Current vs. upstream.** `backend/builder.py`'s `BuildManager.current_commit()` reads the local checkout's HEAD (`git log -1`) and branch. `check_updates()` runs `git fetch --quiet origin` against `origin/master`, then `git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/master` to report how many commits you're behind, plus the latest upstream commit's hash and subject. This check is cached for 15 minutes (`UPDATE_TTL = 900` seconds) so opening the Build tab doesn't `git fetch` GitHub on every visit; a failed fetch is retried sooner (`UPDATE_TTL_FAIL = 60` seconds). The **Check GitHub now** button bypasses the cache with `force=1`, and a finished build clears the cache outright so the next check is fresh.

**Auto-detected build flags.** `backend/hardware.py`'s `recommend()` inspects your GPU(s) (via `nvidia-smi`, or Apple's unified memory on macOS) and CPU, then returns a dict of `{cmake_flags, notes, runtime, gpus, cpu}`:

- On **macOS**, it returns `GGML_METAL=ON` and `GGML_NATIVE=ON`, with a note that Metal uses unified memory as VRAM. No CUDA branch runs on Mac.
- If one or more **NVIDIA GPUs** are detected, it sets `GGML_CUDA=ON`, and if compute capabilities were readable, `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` to the sorted, deduplicated list of detected architectures (e.g. `86;89`). It also sets `GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS=ON` to enable flash attention across all quantized KV cache combinations.
- If **no NVIDIA GPU** is detected, it configures a CPU-only build (no CUDA flags) and notes that fact.
- On Windows/Linux either way, it always sets `GGML_NATIVE=ON`. If the CPU looks like it supports AVX-512 (`avx512_hint` — on Linux read from real CPU flags; on Windows a name-based heuristic for Ryzen 7/9 (7000- and 9000-series), Xeon, and Threadripper parts), it additionally sets `GGML_AVX512=ON`, `GGML_AVX512_VNNI=ON`, `GGML_AVX512_VBMI=ON`, and `GGML_AVX512_BF16=ON`.
- It also returns a `runtime` recommendation (not a CMake flag, but a suggested per-model default): `fit=on` and `flash-attn=auto` on every platform. Memory sizing (context, GPU layers, split) is left to llama.cpp's own `--fit` rather than pinned.

These flags are shown as pills on the Build tab and used as the default for a rebuild; if you've previously saved custom flags (`cmake_flags` in `config.json`), those are shown instead until you clear them.

A rebuild (`BuildManager.run_build()`) runs in a background thread: it first validates that `llama_src`/`build_dir` are set and the source exists (an unset path is reported plainly instead of running `cmake -B  -S ` and surfacing CMake's own error), optionally `git pull --ff-only origin`, backs up the current binaries directory (`bin/Release` on Windows/MSVC, `bin` elsewhere) to a timestamped copy beside it (e.g. `bin/Release-backup-20261006-120000`) before touching anything, runs `cmake -B <build_dir> -S <llama_src> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` with your flags, then `cmake --build <build_dir> --config Release --parallel <jobs>`. Output streams to a log file the dashboard polls live. On success it records where `llama-server` actually landed into `config.json`, so a first build doesn't leave you hand-fixing `server_bin`.

**"Built, with warnings."** `cmake --build` returns a single exit code for the whole build, so a failing non-essential target (the npm/`sharp` UI-asset step on Windows is the common one) used to be reported as a hard **BUILD FAILED** even though `llama-server` itself built. Now, if the build step fails but a *freshly built* `llama-server` is present (freshness proven by comparing its mtime to the build's start, so a stale binary from a previous build can't mask a real compile failure), the build is reported as **built, with warnings** — the binary is recorded and usable, and the failing step is left in the log for you to read. A build that produced no fresh binary is still a hard failure.

**Two llama-family engines.** The Build tab has a **Build Target** toggle (**llama.cpp** / **ik_llama**). Building the `ik_llama` target uses its own `ik_llama_src` / `ik_llama_build_dir` / `ik_llama_cmake_flags` and produces a separate binary. When the target isn't the active engine, a **Switch to <engine>** button (`POST /api/engine/switch`) points the router at it by setting `active_engine` and restarting the router. The switch is gated on a capability probe (`router_ctl.supports_router_mode()`): because LlamaForge drives the router as `<server_bin> --models-preset ...`, a binary whose `llama-server` predates router mode is **refused** with an explanation rather than being switched to and taking the router down. Each engine reads its own `models.ini` (ik_llama uses a `-ikllama` sibling), and the knob editor reflects whichever engine is active.

## How to use it

1. Open the **Build / Update** tab. To skip the compiler, use the **Engine** card at the top (llama.cpp target) and click **Install llama.cpp**. To build from source, the **Or build from source** card (headed **Current Build** on the ik_llama target) shows your checkout's commit, branch, and date; **Upstream** shows whether you're behind `origin/master` and by how many commits.
2. Click **Check GitHub now** to force a fresh upstream check instead of waiting for the 15-minute cache.
3. Review the **Build Flags** pills — these are auto-detected for your GPU/CPU (or your previously saved custom flags, if any).
4. Leave **git pull first** checked (it's checked by default when you're behind) to pull the latest commits before building, or uncheck it to rebuild the current checkout as-is.
5. Click **Pull latest & Rebuild** (or **Rebuild current** if already up to date). The build runs in the background; watch progress and any errors in the Build Log panel below, which polls live until the build finishes or fails.
6. On Windows, the same tab has a **vLLM (pip package in WSL)** card showing its installed vs. latest PyPI version, with an **Update vLLM to <version>** button when a newer release is available.

## Reference

| Concept | Source | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Current commit | `BuildManager.current_commit()` | `git log -1` (hash, subject, date) + current branch on `llama_src`. |
| Upstream check | `BuildManager.check_updates()` | `git fetch` + `git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/master`; cached 15 min (60s on failure), bypassed with `force=1`. |
| Recommended flags | `hardware.recommend()` | Returns `cmake_flags`, human-readable `notes`, a `runtime` suggestion, and the detected `gpus`/`cpu`. |
| macOS flags | `hardware.recommend()` | `GGML_METAL=ON`, `GGML_NATIVE=ON`. |
| NVIDIA GPU flags | `hardware.recommend()` | `GGML_CUDA=ON`, `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=<archs>` (if readable), `GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS=ON`. |
| CPU-only flags | `hardware.recommend()` | No CUDA flags; `GGML_NATIVE=ON` still set. |
| AVX-512 flags | `hardware.recommend()` | `GGML_AVX512`, `GGML_AVX512_VNNI`, `GGML_AVX512_VBMI`, `GGML_AVX512_BF16` — all `ON` when `avx512_hint` is true. |
| Runtime suggestion | `hardware.recommend()["runtime"]` | `fit=on`, `flash-attn=auto` on every platform. |
| Rebuild | `BuildManager.run_build()` | Validates paths, optional `git pull --ff-only`, backs up prior binaries, `cmake` configure + build (Release, parallel jobs = CPU count by default), records the built `server_bin`. |
| Partial success | `BuildManager.run_build()` | Build-step failure with a fresh `llama-server` present → `done_warnings` (amber "built with warnings"); no fresh binary → hard `failed`. |
| Engine target / switch | Build tab toggle, `POST /api/engine/switch` | Builds `llama.cpp` or `ik_llama`; switching sets `active_engine` and restarts the router, refused if the target binary has no router mode. |
| Prebuilt engine | Engine card, `backend/prebuilt.py`, `/api/engine/prebuilt*` | Installs an official ggml-org release (`nightly` or `stable` channel), SHA-256 checked and test-run first; keeps the newest 3 installs, **Use** rolls back. |

## Troubleshooting

If the upstream status shows "check failed," `git fetch` couldn't reach GitHub (network issue, or `llama_src` isn't a valid checkout) — check `llama_src` in `config.json` points at a real git clone. If a build fails, the Build Log panel shows the failing `cmake` step's output; prior binaries are always backed up first (to a `<binaries dir>-backup-<timestamp>` folder beside them, e.g. `bin/Release-backup-…`) so a bad build doesn't leave you without a working server. If flag detection looks wrong (e.g. no GPU found on a machine that has one), verify `nvidia-smi` is on `PATH` and reports the GPU — `hardware.detect_gpus()` shells out to it directly.

See also [Models & Tuning](models.md) for the flags the resulting `llama-server` binary exposes, and [config.json Reference](config.md) for `llama_src`, `build_dir`, `server_bin`, and `cmake_flags`.
