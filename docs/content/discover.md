# Discover Models

Search huggingface.co for GGUF (and safetensors, for vLLM) models directly from the dashboard, see which files will actually fit your GPU before downloading, and pause or resume large transfers.

## What it does

The Discover tab queries the Hugging Face Hub API (`backend/hub.py` `search()`), filtered to repos tagged `gguf`, sorted by downloads, last-modified, or likes. Selecting a repo lists its individual GGUF files (`hub.py` `files()`), which collapses multi-shard files (`*-00001-of-0000N.gguf`) into a single entry with their combined size, and separates out `mmproj` (multimodal projector) files for vision models.

Each file is rated against your hardware. When a prediction is available (the default), the badge comes from `vram_predict.fit_label()`, the same rough estimate that powers the Will-it-run panel. It uses file size (all shards), MoE active-vs-total parameters and your VRAM, with a flat allowance for the KV cache, so treat it as an estimate rather than a guarantee. So a large MoE that runs fast with its experts on CPU reads as **TIGHT**, not **CPU OFFLOAD**, even though it's bigger than your VRAM. When no prediction can be made, the badge falls back to `hub.py`'s size-only `_fit()`:

- **FITS VRAM** — a fast, GPU-resident placement (or, in fallback, file size × 1.15 ≤ total VRAM — the 15% margin covers KV cache and compute headroom).
- **TIGHT** — usable, but with the model partly offloaded to CPU/RAM, or (in fallback) fitting VRAM without clearing the 1.15× margin.
- **CPU OFFLOAD** — generation would be slow, or the weights stream from disk. The model still loads; nothing is ever blocked.
- **?** (unknown) — no VRAM detected and no prediction, so no rating can be made.

Expanding a repo also shows a **Will-it-run** panel that predicts whether a selected quant will fit your GPU and at what approximate speed. It factors in MoE active-vs-total parameters, your GPU's memory bandwidth (with manual overrides in Setup), and the quant's size — then rates it as **FITS**, **TIGHT**, or **CPU OFFLOAD** with a rough tok/s estimate. Treat the speed as a ballpark from memory bandwidth, not a measurement: real speed depends on the build, the quant kernels, and context length. The same estimate appears as a badge when you expand a model in the file list.

Downloads run in a background thread (`hub.py` `DownloadManager`) that streams the file to disk and reports progress the dashboard polls. Pausing keeps the partial `.part` file on disk; resuming re-issues the request with an HTTP `Range` header starting from the bytes already downloaded, so a paused multi-gigabyte download picks up where it left off instead of restarting from zero. Cancelling instead deletes the partial file.

Each result also carries platform tags (Windows/Linux/macOS) — GGUF runs on all three via llama.cpp, so GGUF results always show all three; the tag matching your current machine is highlighted.

## How to use it

1. Open the **Discover** tab. It opens on **New this week**: model architectures llama.cpp just merged, each marked against your engine build, above Hugging Face GGUFs that are new and trending in the last 14 days. Type a query (e.g. `qwen coder`, `gemma vision`) to search, and use the sort dropdown for most downloaded, newest or most liked.
2. Switch the mode dropdown to **safetensors (vLLM)** if you want a full-precision/quantized model for the vLLM backend instead (Windows + WSL2 only — this option is hidden on platforms without vLLM support).
3. Click a repo row to expand its file list. Each file shows its size and a fit badge (FITS VRAM / TIGHT / CPU OFFLOAD).
4. Click **Download** on the file you want. Progress, current file (for multi-file/shard downloads), speed, and ETA appear in the Download card at the top of the tab.
5. Use **Pause** to suspend a running download (the partial file is kept) and **Resume** to continue it later. **Cancel download** stops it and discards the partial file.
6. When a download finishes, LlamaForge adds it to `models.ini` by itself (even if you closed the tab). Click **Load** to load it, or load it later from the Models tab.

## Reference

| Concept | Source | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Search | `backend/hub.py` `search()` | Queries `huggingface.co/api/models?filter=gguf`, sorted by downloads/lastModified/likes. |
| File listing | `backend/hub.py` `files()` | Lists a repo's `.gguf` files, collapsing sharded files and separating `mmproj` files. |
| VRAM-fit rating | `vram_predict.fit_label()`, falling back to `hub.py` `_fit()` | Derived from the rough prediction (gpu-resident → `fits`; usable hybrid/offload → `tight`; slow/streaming → `offload`). Falls back to the size-only heuristic (`fits`: size × 1.15 ≤ VRAM; `tight`: ≤ VRAM; `offload`: > VRAM) when no prediction is available. |
| Will-it-run panel | `POST /api/vram/predict` | Predicts regime + tok/s for a repo+quant using MoE-aware model size, GPU bandwidth (with Setup overrides), and quant factor. |
| Download engine | `backend/hub.py` `DownloadManager` | Background thread; one job at a time; progress polled via `/api/hub/progress`. |
| Pause / resume | `DownloadManager.pause()` / `resume()` | Pause keeps the `.part` file; resume continues via an HTTP `Range` request from the bytes already on disk. |
| Cancel | `DownloadManager.cancel()` | Stops the job and deletes the partial `.part` file. |
| Platform tags | `hub.py` `PLATFORMS` / `web/js/discover.js` `platTags()` | GGUF always tags `windows`/`linux`/`macos`; the tag matching the current machine is highlighted. |

## Troubleshooting

If a search returns an error message instead of results, the request to `huggingface.co` failed (network issue, or Hugging Face is unreachable) — the error text is shown truncated in the search bar's message area. A `GATED` tag on a repo means it requires accepting terms and an HF token on huggingface.co first; downloads of gated repos fail without that. Only one download runs at a time — starting a second while one is active is rejected with "A download is already running."
