# Security

## Control plane and router scope

The LlamaForge dashboard and its management API always bind to `127.0.0.1`
(the `panel_port`, default `8090`). They are a local control plane and are not
made reachable on the LAN. The separate llama.cpp router (`router_port`, default
`8080`) has just two LlamaForge-managed scopes: local `127.0.0.1` or LAN
`0.0.0.0`.

The Setup tab's **Network Access** card changes the router scope, not the
dashboard. Use remote desktop or SSH to administer LlamaForge from another
machine; do not expose the panel port.

## LAN access fails closed

Every newly configured LAN router requires a usable API key, and every
LlamaForge-owned router start or restart repeats that policy check before it
stops or starts a process. There is no unauthenticated-LAN override. Clients use
`Authorization: Bearer <key>` when the upstream router requires it.

Network Access has explicit key actions: keep the current key, generate a new
key, replace it, or clear it (clear is available only for local access). Rotating
a key invalidates clients that use the old one. Switching back to local keeps a
key unless the operator separately confirms its removal.

Older printable keys may continue to protect an existing LAN configuration and
are labelled `protected_legacy` with a rotation recommendation. Historical or
manually edited unsupported hosts, and LAN configurations with an absent or
invalid key, are assessed read-only as `unsafe_legacy`: LlamaForge does not
silently rewrite them, but blocks any new start or restart until they are
repaired. If a port is already occupied, the dashboard leaves its listener
alone; seeing a listener is not verification of its process identity or of its
authentication policy.

## The local router is keyed too

Binding to `127.0.0.1` keeps other machines out, but not web pages: a
`text/plain` POST needs no CORS preflight, and DNS rebinding can make an
attacker's page same-origin with `127.0.0.1`. So the router always runs with an
API key. When you have not set `router_api_key`, LlamaForge generates its own
(`router_local_key` in `config.json`) and adds it server-side to every request
it makes: the dashboard, the Chat tab, the `/v1/messages` shim and the stats
poller. **Client Config** and **Connect an agent** hand that key to the clients
you set up. A local router also gets `--cors-origins localhost` when the
llama-server build supports it.

LAN policy is unchanged: it still requires a key that you set, never the
generated one. On startup the dashboard checks the router already running on
`router_port`. If it answers without a key, or rejects the key LlamaForge
would send, the dashboard restarts it with the current settings (for example
after an upgrade from a build that ran it unkeyed).

A model pinned to its own build runs as a separate `llama-server` process on
127.0.0.1 (from `slot_port_base`, default `8100`). It is started with the same key.

Apps you pointed at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` yourself now need the key: copy it
from **Client Config**, or set your own key in **Network Access**.

## Management boundary and credentials

`/api/state`, `/api/config`, and routine management responses never include the
router key. Their public config projection is an explicit allowlist plus the
non-secret `router_api_key_configured` boolean. **Client Config**, **Show
configuration** for an agent, and server-side **Generate** are deliberate,
no-store reveal actions; they return credentials only to the initiating explicit
POST where applicable. Every JSON response has `Cache-Control: no-store`.

The panel treats every HTTP request as untrusted input:

- Host and Origin checks keep requests tied to this loopback service and defend
  against cross-site requests and DNS rebinding.
- When a POST declares `Content-Type`, it must be `application/json`; declared
  form or other non-JSON types are rejected with 415. This is defense in depth
  against form posts. A missing `Content-Type` is not rejected by this guard.
- POST framing requires one valid `Content-Length`; transfer encoding, malformed
  or duplicate lengths, short bodies, and oversized requests are rejected and
  the connection is closed. Management JSON is capped at 4 MiB; the
  `/v1/messages` and `/v1/chat/completions` inference proxies have a 64 MiB cap
  for realistic multimodal payloads.
- `POST /api/config` accepts only a type-checked allowlist. Request data is not
  interpolated into shell commands.

## Local limitations

`config.json` stores `router_api_key` and `router_local_key` as plaintext; it is not encrypted and is
not an OS credential vault. A process running under the same OS account may be
able to read that file and inspect the llama-server command line, because the
upstream process currently receives `--api-key` in argv. Explicit configuration
previews improve resistance to accidental ambient disclosure, not isolation from
such a local peer process.

## Supported versions

Only the latest release gets security fixes. The running version is shown next
to the LlamaForge name in the sidebar.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report it privately, not in a public issue: use **Report a
vulnerability** on the repo's Security tab
(<https://github.com/dadwritestech/LlamaForge/security/advisories/new>). Include
the version, your OS, and the steps to reproduce. Expect a first reply within a
few days. This is a one-person early-preview project, so there is no bounty, but
you will be credited in the advisory and release notes unless you prefer not to
be.

This is a local tool, not a hosted service, and not a security certification.

## LAN exposure (opt-in)

Three `config.json` keys can move a surface onto the LAN; all default to the
local-only behavior described above and none are set by the dashboard UI:

- `panel_host` and `chat_host` - bind addresses for the dashboard and the chat
  listener. `"0.0.0.0"` (or a fixed address) makes the surface reachable on the
  network. The Host/Origin guard is not disabled: it additionally accepts this
  machine's own addresses and names, so DNS rebinding and cross-site requests
  stay refused. The panel carries no authentication of its own - anything that
  can reach it can drive it - so share it only on a network you trust.
- `router_allow_keyless_lan` - lets a LAN router start without an API key.
  Off by default: a LAN router normally fails closed until a usable key is
  configured. When this is set, the OpenAI-compatible API is open to anyone
  who can reach the port.

- `mcp_host` - binds the optional MCP-over-HTTP listener (`mcp_port`). Off by
  default; the stdio MCP server needs no listener. The HTTP form carries no
  authentication of its own and can load models, download files and run pi
  tasks - same trust level as the LAN panel above.
