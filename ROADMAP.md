# Roadmap

LlamaForge is an **early preview**. This is a direction, not a set of promises —
priorities shift with feedback, and there are no dates. If something here matters
to you, open an issue or 👍 an existing one; that's the strongest signal for what
gets built next.

## Now (shipped)

On `master`, not in a tagged release yet:

- **Several models at once** — multi-model mode keeps a main model and workers
  loaded together; a placement planner checks fit against footprints measured on
  your machine, and a model can be pinned to its own llama.cpp or ik_llama build.
- **Embers** — small local agents that watch a topic, keep a wiki and write a
  brief on a schedule, with **Forge** building one from an interview.
- **MCP server** — drive LlamaForge from Claude Code, Codex or any MCP client
  (stdio), including `pi_run`, which hands a task to the pi coding agent on a
  loaded local model. pi installs from Setup.
- **Voice** — text to speech on your GPU through llama.cpp's own `llama-tts`
  with Qwen3-TTS or Pocket TTS, in a voice you record or upload, plus an OpenAI-style
  `POST /v1/audio/speech` on the panel.
- **Stowage, Hearth and Classic skins** — Stowage, the bay-plan look, is the new
  default.

Released:

- **"New this week"** — the top of Discover lists the model architectures
  llama.cpp just merged, each marked **IN YOUR ENGINE** or **Update engine**
  against the build you run, plus a *new & trending (14 days)* Hugging Face sort
  rated for your VRAM. (v0.11.0)
- **In-app updates** — installer copies see new LlamaForge releases in the
  dashboard: **Update now** installs it (settings, models and engines kept),
  **Restart now** relaunches the panel while loaded models keep serving. (v0.11.0)
- **Launch profiles** — save a model + preset + pinned llama.cpp build as a named
  profile and launch it from a ▶ chip; pinned builds survive update pruning. (v0.12.0)
- **Shareable recipes**: export a profile as JSON and import someone else's, with
  a one-click download of the model if it's missing. Imports drop paths, hosts, keys and tools, and show every knob before you apply it. (v0.13.0)
- **Community recipe gallery**: **browse recipes** lists tested setups from the repo's
  `recipes/` folder (live from GitHub, bundled copy offline); anyone can PR theirs. (v0.14.0)
- **One-line installers** — `irm …/install.ps1 | iex` (Windows) and
  `curl …/install.sh | sh` (Linux/macOS): no git, admin or compiler. A private,
  SHA-256-pinned Python on Windows when needed; Start menu / Apps & Features,
  `llamaforge` command, `.desktop` entry or `LlamaForge.app`. Updates keep your
  settings, models and engines; CI installs, starts the panel, and runs the
  uninstaller on Windows, Ubuntu and macOS arm64. (v0.10.0)
- **One-click official llama.cpp builds** — the right upstream release for your
  GPU (CUDA / Vulkan / Metal / CPU), digest-verified, switchable per version, so
  new model support is an **Update** click away. Building from source stays for
  forks. (v0.10.0)
- **llama.cpp control panel** — per-model tuning of every `llama-server` flag
  (200+ on current builds, parsed live from `--help`); saving hot-reloads the model, no restart.
- **VRAM-fit model discovery** — search HuggingFace GGUFs, each quant rated
  **FITS / TIGHT / CPU OFFLOAD** against your real VRAM before you download. The
  rating is a rough estimate from file size, MoE active params and your VRAM.
- **Guided build & update** — current commit vs upstream, rebuild with CMake
  flags auto-detected for your CPU/GPU.
- **Rides llama.cpp's `--fit`**: context, GPU layers and the multi-GPU split are
  left unset so llama.cpp sizes them to your free VRAM; a `ctx-size` you set is
  clamped to the model's trained length.
- **Setup** — detect/install prereqs (winget/choco), scan drives for GGUFs, and
  prune registry entries whose files were deleted.
- **Usage stats** — per-model tokens, runs, average tok/s, daily activity —
  and optional **LAN sharing** with an API-key toggle.
- **Linux & macOS (early preview)** — `bootstrap.sh` / `run.sh` / `stop.sh`,
  portable process control and drive scanning, Metal build flags and
  unified-memory VRAM-fit ratings on Apple Silicon, package-manager-aware
  Setup (brew; exact install hints on Linux), with CI running the full test
  suite on windows / ubuntu / macos runners.
- **vLLM backend (WSL2)** — a second inference engine alongside llama.cpp for
  safetensors / AWQ / GPTQ / FP8 / NVFP4 models, sharing the same model list,
  Discover tab, and stats. Windows/WSL2-only for now (hidden on Linux/macOS).
- **ik_llama engine** — build and drive **ik_llama.cpp** as a second
  llama-family engine, switched from the Build tab. The switch is gated on a
  router-mode capability probe (a binary without `--models-preset` is refused
  rather than taking the router down); ik_llama keeps its own `models.ini`
  sibling registry, and per-model tuning rides its own parsed `--help` schema.
- **Bind a preset as a model's default** — a named preset can be pinned to a
  model so its knobs travel with it, and editing the preset re-syncs every bound
  model. ([#2](https://github.com/dadwritestech/LlamaForge/issues/2))
- **Auto-wired MTP draft models** — an `mtp-*` sidecar is attached as the
  speculative draft model on scan, enabling `spec-type=draft-mtp` only when the
  file declares NextN layers. ([#3](https://github.com/dadwritestech/LlamaForge/issues/3))
- **Robust first run** — `config.json`/`models.ini` auto-created, relative paths
  anchored, router port-conflict surfaced, freshly installed tools detected
  without a restart, and partial builds reported as "built with warnings."
- **Discover platform tags** — every result shows which OSes its backend runs
  on, plus GATED and INSTALLED badges.
- **Agent-friendly API** — OpenAI-compatible endpoint plus load/unload so agents
  can swap models on demand.
- **Quality-of-life pass** — quick-load from the row + a sequential load queue,
  named knob **presets** (apply to any model), side-by-side **model compare**,
  a **GGUF metadata card** (arch/params/quant/ctx/rope), **inline load-failure
  diagnosis** with a suggested fix, copy-paste **client config** (curl / OpenAI /
  JSON), a keyboard map, **download pause/resume**, **auto-load a model on
  launch**, and an optional system-tray icon.
- **Lite & Advanced modes + guided first run** — a first-run wizard (engine →
  hardware → model → tune → load) and a hardware **auto-tune** that sizes
  GPU-layer offload, KV-cache type, context ceiling, and intent presets
  (balanced / speed / context / coding) to your VRAM. Lite hides the deep knobs;
  Advanced exposes every flag.
- **Anthropic-compatible endpoint** — a `POST /v1/messages` shim (SSE streaming +
  tool use) that translates to the local OpenAI-style router, so Anthropic
  clients (Claude Code and others) run against your local models.
- **One-click agent setup** — a *Connect an Agent* panel that generates and
  optionally writes config for **Claude Code**, **Codex**, and **pi.dev**
  (Claude Code scoped to `127.0.0.1`; existing files backed up before any change).
- **Context Wiki** — a directory of Markdown context docs composed into named
  **profiles**, selected per model, and delivered by proxy injection (Anthropic
  shim + OpenAI proxy) or exported into `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` (marker region).
  The stable prefix rides the router's prompt cache.
- **Light/dark + colorblind-safe theming** — a Light theme adapting the terminal
  identity, plus an orthogonal colorblind-safe mode (universal Okabe–Ito status
  palette + non-color glyph/label cues). Layered persistence: localStorage >
  `config.json` > OS.
- **In-app documentation + published site** — a full docs corpus rendered from one
  Markdown source into an in-app **Help** view and a static **GitHub Pages** site.
- **Collapsible sidebar UI** — navigation moved from a top tab bar to a two-panel
  layout: a left sidebar that collapses between an icon rail and labeled state
  (settings pinned at the bottom), with a responsive overlay drawer on narrow
  windows.

## Next (in progress)

- Nothing claimed right now: see Planned, and open an issue if something matters to you.

## Planned

- **Local-only VRAM-fit predictions** — fit ratings remain entirely on-device.
  LlamaForge will not build hosted or crowdsourced performance reporting.
- **Native (non-WSL) vLLM on Linux** — vLLM currently rides WSL2 on Windows only.

## Under consideration

- More engines as demand shows (TabbyAPI/ExLlama, etc.).
